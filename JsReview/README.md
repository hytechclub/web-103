# JavaScript Review
Review the concepts covered by the [Web 102](https://github.com/hytechclub/web-102/) course, and give the students a chance to practice and re-learn their skills.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Get to know their classmates
- Refresh their memory on Web 102 concepts:
  - Use variables to store data
  - Use HTML `<button>`s to run JavaScript functions
  - Use `if` statements to dynamically control program flow
  - Use DOM Manipulation to retrieve input from `<input>` elements
  - Use DOM Manipulation to display information
  - Use `for` loops to repeat processes in code
- Have fun reviewing the concepts they should know

## Warm-Up: Student Introductions & Gartic Phone Icebreaker
Since this is the first week of the club, allow the students to introduce themselves. They can share their school and grade level, and something fun like their favorite movie or tv show or an interesting fact about themselves.

After the introductions, facilitate a game of Gartic Phone. Gartic Phone is basically online [telestrations](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46213/telestrations) - basically, [telephone](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-the-Telephone-Game) with pictures. Each player writes a sentence, and then those sentences are passed to other players to draw. From there, the drawings are passed to _other_ new players who have to guess what the sentence was (or just make up a new caption for the picture). This continues until the chain of alternating sentences and pictures reaches the (often ridiculous) end.

### Instructions
Follow these instructions to spin up a game:

1. Go to [the Gartic Phone start page](https://garticphone.com/)
1. Enter a name and click "START"
1. Click on the "14 PLAYERS" dropdown and set the maximum number of players appropriately 
1. Click on "CUSTOM SETTINGS" and make sure the "ESTIMATED DURATION" is about 10 minutes
1. Click on "INVITE" to get the URL
1. Share the URL with the students
    - Through Zoom
    - Through the projector (typing manually)
    - Through an ad-hoc [tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com/) link
1. Click on "START"
1. Stop sharing screen, and go through the game
1. When all rounds are complete, present the sentences and drawings everyone did!

## Lecture: JavaScript Crash Course
Present the [JavaScript Crash Course PowerPoint](JsCrashCourse.pptx). This is meant to be a very quick re-hash of everything covered in Web 102. Students may not fully remember everything during the lecture, but they will have a chance to apply the concepts during the [code-along](QuizCodeAlong.md). There is also a [cheat sheet](Web102CheatSheet.md) for them to reference. _Try not to spend too long on this part; it should mainly be used to jog their memory._

## Code-Along: Personal Quiz
Walk through [the instructions](QuizCodeAlong.md) with the students to have them build a short quiz about themselves.

By the end of the activity, the projects should look something like [this](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/rhinestone-pear-jaxartosaurus).

## Self-Paced Work: Quiz Updates
Have the students follow [the instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to continue working on their Personal Quiz from the code-along.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket Quiz Game
Close the session by facilitating the [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/63c82eb286d8642832db5730) to give students a chance to review the concepts from the lecture. Note that a Blooket account is required to host the game.
