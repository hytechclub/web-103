# Consuming an API
This lesson introduces [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) as a powerful tool for one piece of software to communicate with another piece of software. For this course, students will use a variety of supporting JavaScript language features to facilitate the API connection.

A **lot** of concepts are required to enable the use of APIs in JavaScript - students should become familiar with these topics, and see them in action, but they may not fully grasp them (even if they can use them successfully).

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Define _API_ as a term
- Define _HTTP_ as a term, and explain GET requests and responses
- Understand and utilize _query parameters_
- Know that _JavaScript Promises_ exist
- Use `async` and `await` to deal with Promises in code
- Understand and utilize `try`/`catch`/`finally` to handle errors in code
- Use `fetch` to grab data from an _HTTP API_

## Warm-Up: Query Styles
This warm-up asks students to experiment with query parameters, even if they don't know what they are yet! There are some different things they can do, but at minimum, they should change the background color and text color for the page. Minimal instruction should be given; the students should be able to figure it out on their own.

Make sure to wake up the [page](https://QueryStyles.hylandoutreach.repl.co) before club - it is [hosted](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/QueryStyles) on Replit, and sometimes has some issues.

## Lecture 1: API Concepts
The first [presentation](ApiConcepts.pptx) should familiarize the students with several topics that make API connections possible in JavaScript. This is a high-level overview of these concepts, and should not be too technical.

- API definition
- HTTP overview
- HTTP GET requests
- HTTP responses
- Query parameters
- JavaScript promises

## Formative Assessment: Questions Slides
Present the [Questions slides](ApiQuestions.pptx) to review the concepts covered in the first lecture. Call on a random student for each question, and ensure that every student answers at least once.

## Lecture 2: Using APIs
The second [presentation](UsingApis.pptx) dives into the specific code used to work with APIs. This is focused on HTTP APIs called with `fetch`, wrapped in `try`/`catch`, and handled with `await`.

## Code-Along: Dog Fetcher
Follow [the instructions](DogFetcherCodeAlong.md) to build a website that displays random dog pictures.

## Self-Paced Work: Dog Fetcher Updates
If there is time at the end, students should follow the [self-paced work instructions](DogFetcherSelfPacedWork.md) to update their websites.

>_Note: There should be additional time during the next lesson for continued self-paced work and review._
