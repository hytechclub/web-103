# Warm-Up: Function Machine
In JavaScript, [functions](https://javascript.info/function-basics) are a way to run a piece of code on-demand. Parameters are used as function input, and returns are used to give back an output. In math, the concept of functions is similar - often, math functions take some sort of input, and produce an output. In this warm-up, play a math-inspired function game to practice using input and output.

The goal is to use the proper function to match the input bubbles to the bubbles on the field already. Good luck!
