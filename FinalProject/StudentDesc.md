# Final Project

This project is the culmination of everything you have learned over the course of this semester! Let's put it to some use and build something neat!

## Requirements

You aren't limited in what you can create here, but make sure your final project does the following things:

- Connect to one (or more!) APIs to retrieve some sort of data
  - Handle errors gracefully - sometimes APIs break!
- Do something transformative with the data, don't just make a request and show the information exactly as-is.
- Modify your webpage on the fly with the resulting information, to show the end user.

## Some random ideas

Note that you can create whatever you want that meets the requirements! If you are REALLY stuck, here are a few examples:

- A "mood music" site that gets song recommendations based on the current weather and time of day
- A sports match predictor that gets the last game results to guess the outcome of the next game/match
- A random comic strip generator that gets multiple images and overlays text to make a setup and a punchline
- A virtual "game show" built with Trivia APIs that keeps your score over several rounds

## Presentations

We will be showing off Final Projects on the last day of class, be prepared to give a short demonstration of your project and spend a few minutes answering questions.
