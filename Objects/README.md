# Objects & JSON
Introduce [objects](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp) as a way to store related pieces of data.

Note that it is more important for students to be able to _use_ objects than fully understand them at this point. If they can memorize the basic structure and syntax, that should be sufficient.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Create new JavaScript objects
- Access object properties
- Understand how data is stored as JSON

## Warm-Up: Character Builder
Have the students complete the warm-up activity by following [the instructions](WarmUp.md). They will be able to build a character by assigning some basic traits. This leads into the lecture by showing students how traits of a character are like properties of an object. After all students have added characters, they can go around the room and introduce them if there is time.

## Lecture: Objects
The [presentation](Objects.pptx) introduces the concept of objects, explains their importance, and shows the JavaScript syntax. It also touches on JSON data.

There is a mini-quiz at the end of the lecture.

## Review: Object Activity
Facilitate the [Object Activity](ObjectActivity.md). Every student should have a chance to answer at least one of the questions.

## Code-Along: Food Picker
Follow the [instructions](FoodPickerCodeAlong.md) to build up a website meant to help hungry visitors decide which food to eat. By the end of the activity, the project should be something like [this](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/FoodPickerStarterComplete).

## Self-Paced Work: Food Picker Updates
Have the students follow [the instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to continue working on the Food Picker website.
