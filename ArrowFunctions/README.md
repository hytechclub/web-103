# Arrow Functions
This lesson introduces [arrow functions](https://javascript.info/arrow-functions-basics) as another way to define functions. It also introduces some array methods for iteration ([`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) and [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)) that really showcase the power of arrow function syntax.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Recognize the different syntax to define functions
- Pass anonymous arrow functions to other functions
- Understand the power of syntactic sugar
- Practice using functions like `map` and `filter` on arrays

## Warm-Up: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/63d16a6402b104792091fdf5) from the [Callbacks](../Callbacks/README.md) lesson. This will hopefully refresh the students' memory about functions in preparation for the lesson.

## Lecture: Arrow Functions
The [presentation](ArrowFunctions.pptx) reviews anonymous functions, introduces arrow functions as syntactic sugar, and covers a couple array methods where arrow functions are particularly helpful.

## Review: Worksheet
Print out copies of the [worksheet](ArrowFunctionsWorksheet.docx), or direct students to the [online version](Worksheet.md) if they are virtual. Give them time to try to complete the worksheet without assistance. When they turn in their worksheets, check them for correctness against the [answer key](WorksheetAnswers.md), and give them back if there is anything they need to fix.

## Code-Along: Cereal Mascots for Some Reason
Follow the [instructions](MascotsCodeAlong.md) to build up a sweet website. By the end of the activity, the project should look something like [this](https://hytop.onrender.com/e/cereal-mascots-done).

## Self-Paced Work: Trading Card Updates
Students should follow the [self-paced work instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to update their websites. They should be encouraged to change the subjects of the trading cards, and do whatever they would like with the styles.
