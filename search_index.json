create and customize an interactive quiz. These instructions use Ash Ketchum as an example subject, but make sure to change the questions and answers to be about you!\nPart 1 - Setup\nStart by forking the existing project. It contains all of the HTML and CSS, but none of the JavaScript.\n\nNote: You must be logged into Replit to fork the project\n\n\nClick here to open the starter project\nClick the \"Fork Repl\" button in the upper right\nClick the \"Fork Repl\" button in the pop-up that appears\nRun the project to see how it looks!\n\nEverything should show up on the page, but the button will not be functional yet...\nPart 2 - Hooking Up the Button\nThere is currently no JavaScript code, so nothing happens when the button is clicked! Take a look at the  element in the HTML:\nStart the Quiz\n\nThe onclick attribute is trying to call a function named startQuiz - you have to define it!\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAt the top, define a function named startQuiz\nfunction keyword\nFunction name (startQuiz)\nParentheses (())\nCurly brackets ({})\n\n\nMake a new line in the body of the function\nBetween the curly brackets\n\n\nThere, add an alert statement that says \"Loading...\"\nRun the project again, click the button, and verify that a pop-up appears!\n\nThe code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nfunction startQuiz() {\n  alert(\"Loading...\");\n}\n\nPart 3 - Adding a Personal Greeting\nThe button is working, but it's not doing anything too exciting yet. Welcome the user to the quiz with a personalized message using the name they entered in the text input!\n\nMake a new line in the body of the startQuiz function\nThere, create a new variable named nameInput\nSet the nameInput value to get the  element from the HTML\nUse document.querySelector to accomplish this\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named name\nSet the name value to get the actual text from the nameInput element\nUse .value to accomplish this\n\n\nUnder that, add an alert that says \"Hello, NAME! Get ready for some questions...\"\nMake the message into a template string, and replace \"NAME\" with ${name} to use the text from the box\nRun the project again, enter a name in the text box, click the button, and verify that the greeting is personalized!\n\nThe additional code within the body of the startQuiz function should look something like this:\nlet nameInput = document.querySelector(\"#name\");\nlet name = nameInput.value;\n\nalert(`Hello, ${name}! Get ready for some questions...`);\n\nPart 4 - Preparing the Score\nNow it's time to get into the quiz! Start by setting up some storage variables to keep track of the player's score.\n\nMake a new line in the body of the startQuiz function\nThere, create a new variable named score\nSet the score value to 0 to start\nUnder that, create a new variable named numQuestions\nSet the numQuestions value to 3.0 for now\nThe .0 is for calculation purposes\n\n\n\nNote that nothing will actually change when clicking the button again - these variables will be used a bit later. The additional code within the body of the startQuiz function should look something like this:\nlet score = 0;\nlet numQuestions = 3.0;\n\nPart 5 - Asking One Question\nNow that the variables are initialized, this quiz needs some questions! Start with this one:\n\n\n\nQuestion\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nWhat is my name?\nAsh Ketchum\n\n\n\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the startQuiz function\nThere, create a variable named answer1\nSet answer1 to the result of a prompt asking \"What is my name?\"\nUnder that, create an if statement\nif keyword\nParentheses (())\nCurly brackets ({})\n\n\nFor the condition (between parentheses), check if answer1 is equal to \"Ash Ketchum\"\nUse === to compare the two\n\n\nIn the body of the if (between curly brackets), make a new line\nThere, set score to be score + 1\nThis increases the score by 1!\n\n\nClick the button, and verify that the new prompt appears!\n\nThe additional code within the body of the startQuiz function should look something like this:\nlet answer1 = prompt(\"What is my name?\");\nif (answer1 === \"Ash Ketchum\") {\n  score = score + 1;\n}\n\nPart 6 - Asking More Questions\nAdditional questions will use almost exactly the same code as the first question. The only things that will change are:\n\nThe answer variable name (e.g., answer2 instead of answer1)\nThe question text (e.g., \"Where do I live?\" instead of \"What is my name?\")\n\nOther than that, you can follow the steps from Part 5 to add each additional question! Add at least two more:\n\n\n\nQuestion\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I live?\nKanto\n\n\nWhat is my cat's name?\nPikachu\n\n\n\n\nNote: If there are more or less than three questions, the value of the numQuestions variable will need to change\n\nThe code for the additional questions should look something like this:\nlet answer2 = prompt(\"Where do I live?\");\nif (answer2 === \"Kanto\") {\n  score = score + 1;\n}\n\nlet answer3 = prompt(\"What is my cat's name?\");\nif (answer3 === \"Pikachu\") {\n  score = score + 1;\n}\n\nNow the quiz is complete, but the player has no idea if they got the questions right or wrong!\nPart 7 - Calculating and Displaying the Result\nAt this point, the startQuiz function knows the number of correct answers (stored in the score variable), so the final result can be calculated. There will be a little math involved, and then the player will get a nice message saying whether they passed or failed.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the startQuiz function\nThere, add an alert that says \"Calculating...\"\nUnder that, create a variable named scorePercent\nSet the scorePercent variable to be 100 times score divided by numQuestions\nThis is their final percentage based on how many they got right\n\n\nUnder that, create an if/else structure\nif keyword\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\nelse keyword\nMore curly brackets\n\n\nFor the condition (between parentheses), check if scorePercent is greater than 60\nIn the body of the if, use an alert to say \"You passed 😎\"\nIn the body of the else, use an alert to say \"You failed 😭\"\nRun the project, take the quiz, and make sure the calculation is correct!\n\nThe additional code within the body of the startQuiz function should look something like this:\nalert(\"Calculating...\");\nlet scorePercent = 100 * (score / numQuestions);\n\nif (scorePercent > 60) {\n  alert(\"You passed 😎\");\n} else {\n  alert(\"You failed 😭\");\n}\n\nPart 8 - Revealing the Final Score\nA simple \"pass\" or \"fail\" is nice, but the player might want to know their exact score. There is actually already a  element in the HTML just for this purpose! Its text can update dynamically based on the quiz result.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the startQuiz function\nThere, create a new variable named scoreElement\nSet the scoreElement value to get the  element from the HTML\nUse document.querySelector to accomplish this\n\n\nSet the text of the  to a message saying \"You got SCORE correct (PERCENT%)\"\nUse .textContent to accomplish this\n\n\nMake the message into a template string, and replace \"SCORE\" and \"PERCENT\" with ${score} and ${scorePercent}\nThis will use the actual score and percentage values\n\n\nRun the project, take the quiz again, and verify that the correct score appears on the page after it!\n\nThe added code should look something like this:\nlet scoreElement = document.querySelector(\"#score\");\nscoreElement.textContent = `You got ${score} correct (${scorePercent}%)`;\n\nPart 9 - Presenting the Stars\nThe quiz is functionally complete now, but the player might want a bit more of a prize for their efforts. Add some star images to the page based on how many questions the player got right!\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the startQuiz function\nThere, create a for loop structure\nfor keyword\nParentheses (())\nCurly brackets ({})\n\n\nAdd statements within the parentheses to repeat a number of times\nlet i = 0;\ni \ni++\n\n\nMake the loop repeat score times instead of NUMBER times\nThis way, the code in the loop will run once for every correct answer\n\n\nMake a new line in the body of the loop (between curly brackets)\nThere, create a new variable named starImg\nSet starImg to be a newly created  element\nUse document.createElement to accomplish this\n\n\nUnder that, set the src of starImg to be \"star.png\"\nThe star.png file should already be loaded into the Repl project\n\n\nUnder that, append the starImg element to the body of the page\nUse document.body.appendChild to accomplish this\n\n\nRun the project, take the quiz again, and see how many stars you see!\n\nThe added code should look something like this:\nfor (let i = 0; i \nConclusion\nAnd that's it! The quiz should be fully functional and fully fun. The code in the script.js file should look something like this at the end:\nfunction startQuiz() {\n  alert(\"Loading...\");\n\n  let nameInput = document.querySelector(\"#name\");\n  let name = nameInput.value;\n\n  alert(`Hello, ${name}!

It contains some HTML and CSS, but no JavaScript yet 😓\nCreating the Array\nThe first step is to create the array that will store the list of movies.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAt the top of the file, create a new variable named moviesToWatch\nSet it equal to a new array with square brackets: [ and ]\nIn the array, add three string values, separated by commas:  \n\"The Lego Movie\"\n\"Despicable Me\"\n\"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"\n\n\n\nFeel free to change up the films if desired! The code should end up looking something like this:\nlet moviesToWatch = [\"The Lego Movie\", \"Despicable Me\", \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"];\n\nDefining the displayList Function\nNow it's time to start making the buttons functional. In the index.html file, there is a  with an onclick set to call the displayList function... but it doesn't exist yet! It must be defined.\n\nMake a new line under the existing code in the script.js file\nThere, define a new function named displayList:  \nfunction keyword\nFunction name\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), add an alert statement for testing purposes\n\nRun the project, and verify that clicking the \"Display List\" button properly executes the code in the newly defined function! It should look something like this:\nfunction displayList() {\n  alert(\"Displaying List...\");\n}\n\nLooping Through the Array\nNow that the button is hooked up to a function, we have to make sure the function actually does something! The goal is for this function to display each movie in the moviesToWatch array. This will be possible with a for loop!\n\nDelete the alert from the body of the displayList function\nIn its place, create the basic for loop structure:  \nfor\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\n\n\nFor the first expression of the loop in the parentheses (init), create a variable i and set it to 0\nFor the second expression (cond), check if i is less than the length of the array\nFor the final expression (inc), add one to the value of i\nNow, in the body of the for loop (between { and }), create a new variable movieTitle\nSet the movieTitle variable to be the value in the moviesToWatch array at the current index\nUnder that, use an alert to display the current movieTitle\n\nRun the project, click the \"Display List\" button, and verify that all movie titles are displayed! The code in the body of the displayList function should look something like this:\nfor (let i = 0; i \nDisplaying Movies in HTML\nShowing the movies in pop-ups is functional, but the user experience could definitely be better. Use some DOM manipulation to add the array items to the HTML list instead!\nGetting the List Element\nThe first step will be to grab the HTML  so that we can add things to it.\n\nMake a new line at the top of the body of the displayList function\nThere, create a new variable named listElement\nSet the value of listElement to be the HTML element with an id of list\nUnder that, set the innerHTML of the listElement variable to be empty\n\nNothing should change at this point, but storing the listElement value will make it possible to add list items for each movie! The additional JavaScript code should look something like this: \nlet listElement = document.querySelector(\"#list\");\nlistElement.innerHTML = \"\";\n\nCreating the List Items\nNow that the  has been attained, it will be possible to add some list items! All of this will take place in the body of the for loop.\n\nIn the body of the for loop (within the displayList function), remove the alert statement\nIn its place, create a new variable named itemElement\nSet the value of itemElement to be a newly-created HTML  element\nUnder that, set the textContent of the itemElement variable to be the current movie title\nUnder that, append itemElement to listElement\n\nRun the project, click the button, and verify that the movies are added to the page as bulleted list items! The additional code should look something like this:\nlet itemElement = document.createElement(\"li\");\nitemElement.textContent = movieTitle;\n\nlistElement.appendChild(itemElement);\n\nDefining the addMovie Function\nNow the basic list is all set up, but what if we want to add a new movie? There is an \"Add Movie\" button, but its function does not exist yet! Let's define it.\n\nMake a new line under the existing code in the script.js file\nThere, define a new function named addMovie:  \nfunction keyword\nFunction name\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), add an alert statement for testing purposes\n\nRun the project, and verify that clicking the \"Add Movie\" button properly executes the code in the newly defined function! It should look something like this:\nfunction addMovie() {\n  alert(\"Adding Movie...\");\n}\n\nGetting the New Movie\nNow the button has been hooked up, but the function needs to do a lot more than it's currently doing! To start, it needs to get a new movie from the user.\n\nIn the body of the addMovie function, create a new variable named movieToAdd\nSet the value of movieToAdd to be the result of a prompt statement\nSet the text of the prompt to ask \"Which movie do you want to add?\"\n\nRun the project, and verify that clicking the \"Add Movie\" button will now prompt the user for a new movie! The added code should look something like this:\nlet movieToAdd = prompt(\"Which movie do you want to add?\");\n\nAdding the New Movie\nNow we have the movie they want to add, so we can add it to the array!\n\nMake a new line under the movieToAdd variable, still in the body addMovie\nCall the push function on the moviesToWatch array\nPass in movieToAdd as the argument for the function\nUnder that, call the displayList function to update the HTML\n\nRun the project, and verify that a new movie can be added to the list on the page! The added code should look something like this:\nmoviesToWatch.push(movieToAdd);\ndisplayList();\n\nThe basic functionality of the Movie Watchlist should now be working as expected!\nFinal Code\nBy the end of the activity, the JavaScript code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nlet moviesToWatch = [\"The Lego Movie\", \"Despicable Me\", \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"];\n\nfunction displayList() {\n  let listElement = document.querySelector(\"#list\");\n  listElement.innerHTML = \"\";\n\n  for (let i = 0; i \n"},"Arrays/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"Arrays/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: Movie Watchlist Updates\nFollow these instructions to update the movie watchlist website.\nNumbered HTML List\nCurrently, the list displays with bullet points. Update the code in the index.html file to make the list display as an ordered list.\nMore Different Starting Movies\nCurrently, there should be three movies when the moviesToWatch array is initially created. Under that, add some new movies to the list! In addition to adding new movies, update some of the existing movies as well.\nRemember, to add an item to an array, use the push function. It should look something like this for an array named myArray:\nmyArray.push(\"My new item\");\n\nTo update an existing value in an array, use the array name, square brackets, and the index of the value. It should look something like this for an array named myArray:\nmyArray[1] = \"My updated second item\";\n\nNote that the updates to the array values should not happen when the array is initially created! The line below should remain the same:\nlet moviesToWatch = [\"The Lego Movie\", \"Despicable Me\", \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"];\n\nMovie Edits\nCurrently, there is no way to adjust a movie once it has been added to the Watchlist. Create a button that will allow the user to do this!\nAdding a Button in HTML\nThe first step is to create a new HTML button element.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nFind the existing  elements (within a ), and make a new line under the last one\nThere, create a new  element\nSet the onclick of the button to call a function named editMovie\nSet the text of the button to say \"Edit a Movie\"\n\nRun the project, and verify that a new button appears! It should not do anything yet, though.\nHooking Up the Button in JavaScript\nNow it's time to make the button run some code.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a couple new lines at the bottom of the file\nThere, define a new function named editMovie\nfunction keyword\nFunction name\nParentheses ()\nCurly brackets {}\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), add an alert statement for testing\n\nRun the project, and verify that a pop-up message appears when the \"Edit a Movie\" button is clicked!\nGetting the Index of the Value to Update\nNext, grab the index of the movie from the user. Remember, to convert a string to a number, use code that looks something like this:\nlet myString = \"47\";\n\nlet myNumber = Number(myString);\n\n// myNumber will be the number 47 instead of the text \"47\"\n\n\nRemove the alert from the body of the editMovie function\nIn its place, create a new variable named idxString\nSet idxString to a prompt\nSet the text for the prompt to say \"Enter the index of the movie you would like to edit.\"\nUnder that, create a new variable named idx\nCall the Number function on idxString to set the value of idx\n\nRun the project, click the button, and verify that the prompt appears!\nGetting the New Value\nNext, grab the new title the user would like for the given index.\n\nMake a new line in the body of the editMovie function\nOn that line, create a new variable named newTitle\nSet newTitle to a prompt\nSet the text for the prompt to say \"Enter a new value for the movie title.\"\n\nRun the project, click the button, and verify that two prompts appear!\nSetting the New Title\nNow it's time to actually update the list! Remember, to set the value of an array at a certain index, use code that looks something like this:\nlet myArray = [\"Banana\", \"Apple\"];\nlet myIndex = 1;\n\nmyArray[myIndex] = \"Orange\";\n\n// myArray will be [\"Banana\", \"Orange\"]\n\n\nMake a new line in the body of the editMovie function\nOn that line, value of the moviesToWatch array at the index of idx to be newTitle\nUnder that, call the displayList function to update the HTML\n\nRun the project, and test out the \"Edit a Movie\" button! At this point, it should be fully functional 😎\nChallenge 1 - Item Number Instead of Index\nCurrently, the editMovie function will edit an item by its index. For example, if the user entered 1 for the index, it would edit the second item in the array. Update this so that instead of using the index directly, it subtracts one from what the user enters; that way, if for example the user enters 2 for the item they want to edit, it will edit the item at index 1 (the actual 2nd element)!\nChallenge 2 - Deleting a Movie\nCurrently, there is no way to remove a movie from the watchlist. Add a button that allows the user to delete an item by its index!\nCreating a Button\nStart by creating a new  element in the index.html file. Set its onclick attribute to call a function named deleteMovie. Then, in the script.js file, define the function named deleteMovie.\nGetting the Index\nGetting the index to delete will be very similar to the editMovie function. Use a prompt to get the index string value, and then make sure to convert it to a number using the Number function! After this step, you should have a variable named idx that holds the index to delete.\n\nFor a more friendly user experience, subtract 1 from this idx before using it - that way, the number will line up with the position in the displayed list.\n\nRemoving the Value from the Array\nRead through these instructions to learn how to remove the value at the idx index.\nBackground\nUnfortunately, there is not a direct way to do this in JavaScript; however, the splice method generally works fairly well. Here is an example, and here is some more in-depth documentation. It can end up looking something like this:\nlet myArray = [\"Planes\", \"Trains\", \"Scooters\", \"Automobiles\"];\nlet indexToDelete = 2;\nlet numberOfElementsToDelete = 1;\n\nmyArray.splice(indexToDelete, numberOfElementsToDelete);\n\n// myArray will be [\"Planes\", \"Trains\", \"Automobiles\"]\n\nThere are many ways to use splice, but if you just want to remove a value, you can pass in the index of the value to delete as the first argument, and 1 as the second argument. This will delete 1 element at that index.\nCode to Add\nFor the deleteMovie function, use the splice function to remove one value at the idx index. Remember, moviesToWatch is the array name, splice is the function, idx is the first argument, and 1 is the second argument.\nAfter the splice, make sure to call the displayList function to update the HTML on the page!\nConclusion\nAt this point, the \"Delete a Movie\" button should be fully functional. Run the project, click on the button, enter an index, and verify that the item disappears from the list!\nChallenge 3 - Persistent Movies\nThis challenge will require a bit of additional research. The goal is to store the list of movies somewhere so that if a user reloads the page, it remembers what the movies were.\nBackground: Local Storage\nThis is possible using something called localStorage - it's basically a way to store data in the browser for a given user. This can make basic front-end web applications much more powerful!\nlocalStorage has two main functions: storing values (setting), and retrieving values (getting).\nSetting an Item\nSetting an item looks like this:\nlet myValue = \"This will be stored\";\n\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"myValue\", myValue);\n\nGetting an Item\nIf an item has already been stored, you can get it like this:\nlet myValue = localStorage.getItem(\"myValue\");\n\nBackground: JSON Strings\nThe localStorage object can only store string values - this means that we cannot directly store an array. However, it is possible to work around this using JSON strings. Essentially, we can convert an array to a string to store it, and then convert it back to an array when we grab it.\nArray to String\nTo convert an array into a string, use JSON.stringify like this:\nlet myArray = [\"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\"];\n\nlet myString = JSON.stringify(myArray);\n\n// myString will be the string version of the array: `[\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\",\"Wednesday\"]`\n\nString to Array\nTo convert a string into an array, use JSON.parse like this:\nlet myString = `[\"Sunday\",\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\"]`;\n\nlet myArray = JSON.parse(myString);\n\n// myArray will be the actual array object: [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n\nBackground: localStorage + JSON Strings\nCombine these two concepts to successfully store array objects within localStorage! Here is a brief explanation.\n// Storing myArray in localStorage\nlet myArray = [\"Leonardo\", \"Raphael\", \"Donatello\", \"Michelangelo\"];\nlet myArrayString = JSON.stringify(myArray);\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"myArray\", myArrayString);\n\n// Retrieving myArray from localStorage\nlet myStoredArrayString = localStorage.getItem(\"myArray\");\nlet myStoredArray = JSON.parse(myStoredArrayString);\n\n// At this point, myStoredArray will contain the array object from myArray!\n\nImplementation: Updating the Movie Watchlist\nAfter trying to grasp the concepts of localStorage and JSON strings, apply them to the Movie Watchlist website!\nStoring the Movies Array\nA good place to store the current movies would be in the displayList function.\n\nGo to the bottom of the displayList function\nCreate a new variable named stringToStore\nCall the JSON.stringify function on moviesToWatch, and store it in the stringToStore variable\nUnder that, call the localStorage.setItem function\nPass in \"moviesToWatch\" as the first argument, and stringToStore as the second argument\n\nThis should successfully store the value in localStorage every time the user clicks the \"Display List\" button. It is possible to check this out by opening up developer tools, going to the \"Application\" window, and clicking on the \"localStorage\" option. Here is a quick example - it's not necessary to look at it there, but it's pretty cool!\nRetrieving the Movies Array\nNow that the movies array has been stored, it can be retrieved! Instead of setting the moviesToWatch array statically at the top of the file, use localStorage to check if there is a stored version of the array.\n\nAt the very top of the file, create a new variable named storedMoviesString\nCall the localStorage.getItem function, passing in \"moviesToWatch\" as the argument\nSet storedMovieString to this value\n\n\nUnder that, create the moviesToWatch variable - but with no value!\nUnder that, create an if/else structure\nFor the if condition, simply pass in storedMoviesString\nThis checks if the variable has any value\n\n\nIn the body of the if (between { and }), set the moviesToWatch variable\nCall JSON.parse, and pass in storedMoviesString - store that result inb moviesToWatch\nIn the body of the else, set the moviesToWatch variable to the original starter array\n\nNow, the first time the page loads, it should set the moviesToWatch array to [\"The Lego Movie\", \"Despicable Me\", \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"]. However, if the user decides to add, edit, or delete any movies, the moviesToWatch array should update, and persist to localStorage. When the page is loaded again, it should retrieve the stored movie list!\n"},"Arrays/Challenges.html":{"url":"Arrays/Challenges.html","title":"Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Challenges\nTry to complete these challenges that deal with a playlist website.\nStart by forking this Repl project. Then, try to update the site in a variety of ways! Feel free to hop around whichever challenges interest you the most.\nChallenge 1 - Updating the Picture\nThe jumbotron header has a background image, but it might not be something you like. Find another picture online, add it to your Repl project, and update the background-image property in the style.css file!\nChallenge 2 - Updating the Colors\nThe colors are designed to match the background image of the jumbotron. Update any of the colors in the style.css file to match your own personal taste!\nChallenge 3 - Updating the Songs\nThere are currently six songs in the playlist. Update some of these songs so that they reflect your favorite songs! This should take place in the script.js file.\nNote that the string values in the songs array are formatted in a specific way: \"Song Title|Artist\". Make sure your new songs fit that format, with the song title first, then a pipe character (|), then the song artist.\nTry to modify the songs array without changing the first line of the script.js file! Use .push, or songs[1] = \"Soemthing|Else\", to change the values in the array.\nChallenge 4 - No More \"Fill Playlist\" Button\nCurrently, it is necessary to click the \"Fill Playlist\" button in order to add songs to the playlist. Fix this so that the songs are added automatically when the page loads! This is possible by using the  defer attribute to make sure the JavaScript code runs after the HTML has been parsed. \n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nAdd a defer attribute to the  element\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line at the very bottom, under the fillPlaylist function\nCall the fillPlaylist function directly\n\nReload the page, and the songs should appear automatically without having to click a button!\nChallenge 5 - Album Column\nCurrently, the songs array stores two pieces of information for each song - the song title, and the song artist. Update the songs array so that each string contains an album as well, and then modify the code so that it displays an album column!\nReview some of these resources to learn more:\n\nThe split function\nExample\n\n\nDestructuring assignment\n\nThen, try to apply those concepts:\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nIn the songs array, modify each string by adding a | to the end\nAfter each new |, add an album title (feel free to make stuff up)\nWithin the fillPlaylist function, in the for loop body, find where the currentSong.split happens\nTo the left of that, add album to the title and artist variables being set\nUpdate the column sizes for title and artist\nChange \"col-sm-5\" to \"col-sm-4\" for both\n\n\nCreate another HTML  element for the album title\nAdd \"col-sm-2\" to its classList\nSet its textContent to the album variable set above\nAppend the created album  to the songRow element\n\nRun the project, and see the albums show up in the list!\nChallenge 6 - Playing Actual Songs\nThe most hardest part of this challenge may be finding audio files, so do not worry too much about that. The more technical challenges may also be difficult!\nFunction for the Play Buttons\nIt will be beneficial to learn more about anonymous functions to accomplish this. Basically, it is possible to pass around JavaScript functions as objects, and they do not need names. This allows custom, dynamic functionality to be applied at different points in the code. Here's a brief example:\nlet myNamelessFunction = function () {\n  alert(\"This is a function\");\n}\n\nmyNamelessFunction();\n\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nIn the body of the fillPlaylist function, within the for loop, find where the playBtn variable is set\nSet the onclick of the playBtn to be a new anonymous function\nIn the body of the anonymous function, use an alert to display a pop-up with the title of the current song title\n\nRun the code at this point to make sure each play button is hooked up!\nPlaying Audio\nThe next step will be to actually play some audio. You will want to find some audio files and pull them into your Repl project first. Once you have done that, you can play them! It looks something like this:\nlet audio = new Audio(\"audio_file.mp3\");\naudio.play();\n\nYou can adjust the files so that each file matches the song title... for example, if the song title is \"Baba O'Riley\", the file should be called Baba O'Riley.mp3. That way, you can get the filename from the title like so:\nlet filename = `${title}.mp3`;\n\nIt should then be possible to play it! Try it out and see if you can get it working.\nChallenge 7 - Adding and Deleting Songs\nUpdate this website so that it has more of the functionality from the Movie Watchlist!\n\nCreate a button that allows a user to add a song to the end of the list\nNext to each item in the list, create a button that allows the user to remove that item from the list\n\nThis may be quite challenging, but it is definitely possible 😁\nChallenge 8 - Saving the List with localStorage\nSimilar to the challenge from the Self-Paced Work, try to use localStorage to store the songs array so it persists!

They are in the pictures folder.\n\nOpen the index.html file\nNotice there is a  element with an id of food-pic\nThis can store the name of the random item picture!\n\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line in the body of the getFood function\nCreate a new variable named foodPictureElement\nSet foodPictureElement to select the  element\nUsing document.querySelector\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named foodPictureUrl\nSet foodPictureUrl to be pictures/URL\nMake the string into a template literal\nIn the literal, replace URL with ${item.picture}\nThis gets the picture property of the item object\n\n\nSet the src property of foodPictureElement to foodPictureUrl\nThis sets the actual image URL so that it displays on the page\n\n\n\nRun the project, click the button, and verify that a random food item picture is properly displayed! The additional code should look something like this:\nlet foodPictureElement = document.querySelector(\"#food-pic\");\nlet foodPictureUrl = `pictures/${item.picture}`;\nfoodPictureElement.src = foodPictureUrl;\n\nCreating a Greek Salad Object\nThe page should now be fully functional! All that's left is adding some additional food items. Start by creating a new object for a greek salad from Panera.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nMake sure it's outside of the getFood function (after the })\n\n\nThere, create a new variable named greekSalad\nSet greekSalad to be a new empty object with { and }\nPress Enter to automatically add space between\n\n\nIn the object, create a store property set to \"Panera\"\nProperty name, colon, property value, comma\n\n\nUnder that in the object, create two more properties:  \nprice set to 10\npicture set to greeksalad.jpg\n\n\n\nThe new code should look something like this:\nlet greekSalad = {\n  store: \"Panera\",\n  price: 10,\n  picture: \"greeksalad.jpg\"\n};\n\nIt will not change the functionality of the site yet - the item must be added to the items array!\nAdding the Greek Salad Object\nNow the greekSalad is almost ready, but there are a couple things still needed before it will show up as a food item.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, set the name property of the greekSalad object to be \"Greek Salad\"\nThis ensures that it has a name for the display!\n\n\nUnder that, push the greekSalad object to the items array\n\nAt this point:\n\nThe name property has been added to the greekSalad object\nThe greekSalad object has been added to the items array\n\nRun the project, click the button a few times, and verify that the Greek Salad eventually appears! Note that it may be helpful to remove the alert statement from the top of the getFood function for usability purposes. Replit also runs slowly sometimes, so if the image is not changing, it may be necessary to wait several seconds.\nThe additional code should look something like this:\ngreekSalad.name = \"Greek Salad\";\nitems.push(greekSalad);\n\nCreating and Adding a Mac n Cheese Object\nNow it will be possible to add new items in a few different ways! Add a Mac n Cheese item to the menu.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, create a new variable named mac\nSet mac to be a new empty object with { and }\nPress Enter to automatically add space between\n\n\nIn the object, create a store property set to \"Panera\"\nProperty name, colon, property value, comma\n\n\nUnder that in the object, create a name property set to \"Mac n Cheese\"\nUnder that in the object, create a price property set to 7\nUnder that in the object, create a picture property set to \"macncheese.jfif\"\nNote that there is a file in the pictures folder named macncheese.jfif\n\n\nUnder that, outside the object (after }), make a new line\nThere, push the mac object to the items array\n\nRun the project, click the button a few times, and verify that the Mac n Cheese eventually appears! The additional code should look something like this:\nlet mac = {\n  store: \"Panera\",\n  name: \"Mac n Cheese\",\n  price: 7,\n  picture: \"macncheese.jfif\"\n};\n\nitems.push(mac);\n\nCreating and Adding a Soup Object\nIt is also possible to add a new item directly without creating a separate variable! Add Soup to the possible Panera food items in this manner.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nPush a currently empty object to the items array\nAdd a store property to the pushed object set to \"Panera\"\nAdd a name property to the pushed object set to \"Soup\"\nAdd a price property to the pushed object set to 6\nAdd a picture property to the pushed object set to \"panerabread.jpg\"\n\nRun the project, click the button a few times, and verify that the Soup eventually appears! The additional code should look something like this:\nitems.push({\n  name: \"Soup\",\n  price: 6,\n  picture: \"panerabread.jpg\"\n});\n\nConclusion\nThat's it for the code-along activity! At this point, it should be possible to click the button, and see a variety of different foods appear.\nThe added code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nfunction getFood() {\n  let randomItemIndex = getRandomInt(items.length);\n  let item = items[randomItemIndex];\n\n  let foodNameElement = document.querySelector(\"#food-name\");\n  let foodNameText = `${item.name} (${item.store})`;\n  foodNameElement.textContent = foodNameText;\n\n  let foodPictureElement = document.querySelector(\"#food-pic\");\n  let foodPictureUrl = `pictures/${item.picture}`;\n  foodPictureElement.src = foodPictureUrl;\n}\n\nlet greekSalad = {\n  store: \"Panera\",\n  price: 10,\n  picture: \"greeksalad.jpg\"\n};\n\ngreekSalad.name = \"Greek Salad\";\nitems.push(greekSalad);\n\nlet mac = {\n  store: \"Panera\",\n  name: \"Mac n Cheese\",\n  price: 7,\n  picture: \"macncheese.jfif\"\n};\n\nitems.push(mac);\n\nitems.push({\n  store: \"Panera\",\n  name: \"Soup\",\n  price: 6,\n  picture: \"panerabread.jpg\"\n});\n\nNext Steps\nClick here to view the self-paced work instructions.\n"},"Objects/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"Objects/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work\nFollow these instructions to update the Food Picker website.\nNew Items\nFeel free to add any new items desired!

Instead of doing this, ask the user which restaurant they would like to visit, and then choose randomly from that restaurant's items.\nHTML: Restaurant Name Input Element\nStart by creating a new element in the HTML where the user can enter a restaurant name.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nFind the opening  element with the welcome message\nMake a new line under that, and create a new  element\nSet the text to say \"Enter a restaurant: \"\nAfter that, within the  and , create an  element\nSet the id of the  to be \"restaurant\"\n\nRun the project and verify that the text box appears on the page.\nJavaScript: Getting the Restaurant Name\nNext, select the new  element, and get its value.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line at the top of the getFood function\nThere, create a new variable named restaurantNameInput\nSet restaurantNameInput to select the  element\nUsing document.querySelector\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named restaurantName\nSet restaurantName to be the value of the restaurantNameInput variable\n\nNow the name is ready to go.\nJavaScript: Finding the Items for the Restaurant\nOnce the name has been retrieved, it will be possible to use it to find the proper object for the restaurant.\n\nUnder the restaurantName variable, make a couple new lines in the getFood function\nThere, create a new variable named restaurantItems set to an empty array []\nNext, create a for loop to loop through each element in the items array\nfor\nParentheses\nCurly Brackets\nInitialization (let i = 0)\nCondition (i )\nIncrement (i++)\n\n\nIn the body of the for loop, create an if statement\nif\nParentheses\nCurly Brackets\n\n\nFor the condition, check if items[i].store is equal to restaurantName\nThis means the current index has an item from the given restaurant\n\n\nIn the body of the if, push the items[i] object to the restaurantItems array\n\nNow the restaurantItems variable should be ready to go! Replace the items references in the code below with restaurantItems to ensure that only items from the given restaurant are available.\nRun the project, enter a restaurant name, and click the button. It should only choose food items from that restaurant!

Update the code so they can select only vegetarian items!\nHTML: Vegetarian Only Checkbox\nStart by creating a new element in the HTML where the user can check whether they'd like only vegetarian items.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nFind the  element with the restaurant name \nMake a new line under that, and create a new  element\nSet the text to say \"Vegetarian items only? \"\nAfter that, within the  and , create an  element\nSet the type of the  to be \"checkbox\"\nSet the id of the  to be \"veg\"\n\nRun the project and verify that the checkbox appears on the page.\nJavaScript: Getting the Checkbox Value\nNow the checkbox is there, but its value must be retrieved.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the restaurantItems variable declaration\nMake a new line above the variable\nThere, create a new variable named vegetarianCheckbox\nSet vegetarianCheckbox to select the  element\nUsing document.querySelector\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named vegOnly\nSet vegOnly to be the checked property of the vegetarianCheckbox variable\n\nNow the function knows if non-vegetarian items should be filtered out, but it still does not know which items are vegetarian!\nJavaScript: Vegetarian Property\nCurrently, the item objects do not have a property denoting which items are vegetarian.\nGo through each item object, within the restaurants variable and manually add a veg property - it should be set to true of the item can be vegetarian, and false if the item contains meat.\nJavaScript: Filtering the List\nThere is a very helpful filter function that makes it possible to filter arrays based on functions that return booleans. Passing functions as variables and using arrow function syntax are concepts that will be covered later in this course. For now, try to figure out how to use filter even if you don't fully understand it!\n\nUnder the restaurantItems variable in the getFood function, make a new line\nThere, create an if statement\nFor the condition, check if vegOnly is true\nIn the body, set the restaurantItems variable to a call to restaurantItems.filter\nFor the filter call, pass in a function checking if an item has a veg property set to true\nitem => item.veg\n\n\n\nRun the project, check the box, and verify that only vegetarian items appear!\n"},"Callbacks/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Callbacks/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - Functions & Callbacks","keywords":"","body":"Functions & Callbacks\nLearn how to use functions as objects and pass them into other functions!\nWarm-Up: Function Machine Game\nClick here for the warm-up activity instructions.\nPowerPoint Presentation\n\n\nCode-Along: Funktional Functions\nClick here for the code-along starter code.\nClick here for the code-along instructions.\nSelf-Paced Work: Funktional Functions Updates\nClick here for the self-paced work instructions.\nChallenges\nClick here for some additional challenges.\nResources\n\nW3Schools Introduction to Callbacks\nJAVASCRIPT.INFO Function Basics\n\n"},"Callbacks/WarmUp.html":{"url":"Callbacks/WarmUp.html","title":"Warm-Up","keywords":"","body":"Warm-Up: Function Machine\nIn JavaScript, functions are a way to run a piece of code on-demand.

Take a look at the current code in the script.js file:\n\nbassAudio object and playBass function definition - these make it possible to play an audio track!\nchooseRandom function definition - this makes it possible to choose a random item from an array, and exclude any item in particular\nMany document.querySelector calls - these will all store HTML elements in variables to make them easier to access later in the code\n\nThere is a lot of setup, but nothing is actually functional yet. Run the project and notice that none of the buttons actually work!\nHooking Up the Bass Button\nAll of the bass-playing functionality is ready to go, but the function is not being called anywhere! Hook it up to the button with addEventListener.\n\nOpen the index.html file\nNotice the \"🎸 ⏯\"  element has an id of \"play-pause-bass\"\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nNotice the playPauseBassButton variable stores the proper HTML button\nMake a new line at the bottom of the file\nCall addEventListener on the playPauseBassButton object\nPass in \"click\" as the first argument\nPass in playBass as the second argument\nNote: this is the actual function as a variable, not a function call!\n\n\n\nRun the project again, click the \"🎸 ⏯\" button, and verify that Bootsy Collins starts playing!\nThe added line of code should look something like this:\nplayPauseBassButton.addEventListener(\"click\", playBass);\n\nDefining the Random Background Filter Function\nNow the \"🎸 ⏯\" button is good to go - the next button to hook up is the \"Swap Color\" button. This one doesn't have a function defined yet, but the function should change the background filter to a random color.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, create a new variable named randomBgFilter\nSet randomBgFilter to be a new function\nfunction keyword\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), make a new line\nThere, set the backgroundColor of backgroundFilterDiv.style to \"yellow\"\n\nNothing will change quite yet... the randomBgFilter function still needs to be hooked up to the proper button! The new function code should look something like this:\nlet randomBgFilter = function() {\n  backgroundFilterDiv.style.backgroundColor = \"yellow\";\n}\n\nHooking Up the Swap Color Button\nNow a basic version of the function is ready, but it needs to be hooked up.\n\nOpen the index.html file\nNotice the \"Swap Color\"  element has an id of \"color-swapper\"\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nNotice the colorSwapperButton variable stores the proper HTML button\nMake a new line at the bottom of the file\nCall addEventListener on the colorSwapperButton object\nPass in \"click\" as the first argument\nPass in randomBgFilter as the second argument\nNote: this is the actual function as a variable, not a function call!\n\n\n\nRun the project again, click the \"Swap Color\" button, and verify that the filter changes to yellow!\nThe added line of code should look something like this:\ncolorSwapperButton.addEventListener(\"click\", randomBgFilter);\n\nFilling Out the Random Background Filter Function\nAt this point, the randomBgFilter function is doing something, but it's not working quite right. Instead of only setting the color to yellow, it should choose a random color from an array.\n\nMake a new line at the top of the body of the randomBgFilter function\nThere, create a new variable named currentColor\nSet currentColor to backgroundFilterDiv.style.backgroundColor\nThis is the current filter color so the function can make sure it's a new color this time\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named colors\nSet colors to be an array containing red, orange, yellow, cyan, green, and purple\nUnder that, create a new variable named randomColor\nSet randomColor to be a call to chooseRandom\nThis function is defined earlier in the script.js file\n\n\nPass in colors as the first argument, and currentColor as the second\nThis will choose a random color while avoiding the current color\n\n\nNext, change the \"yellow\" to randomColor so it uses the randomly chosen color\n\nRun the project, click the \"Swap Color\" button a bunch, and verify that there is a new color each time! The body of the randomFilterBg function should look something like this:\nlet currentColor = backgroundFilterDiv.style.backgroundColor;\nlet colors = [\"red\", \"orange\", \"yellow\", \"cyan\", \"green\", \"purple\"];\nlet randomColor = chooseRandom(colors, currentColor);\nbackgroundFilterDiv.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;\n\nDefining the Start Cycle Function and Hooking Up the Button\nNow, it's pretty funkalicious that the background color can change. However, it would be even more funkalicious if it could happen automatically! This is possible with setInterval, and the randomBgFilter function already defined.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nDefine a new function named startCycle\nfunction keyword\nFunction name (startCycle)\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the startCycle function (between { and }), make a new line\nThere, call the setInterval function\nPass in randomBgFilter as the first argument, and 250 as the second\nThis will cause the function to run once every 250ms\n\n\nOutside the function definition, make a new line\nHook up the startCycleButton to run the startCycle function when clicked\nUse startCycleButton.addEventListener\n\n\n\nRun the project, click the \"Start Cycle\" button, and see the colors cycle automatically!\nThe code should look something like this:\nfunction startCycle() {\n  setInterval(randomBgFilter, 250);\n}\n\nstartCycleButton.addEventListener(\"click\", startCycle);\n\nStopping the Cycle: Tracking the Cycle Interval Id\nNow the cycle has begun, but there is no way to stop it! That could get annoying. Luckily, there is a way to keep track of any currently running function intervals - the setInterval function will return an ID value that can be used to track its usage.\n\nMake a new line above the startCycle function definition\nThere, define a new variable named cycleIntervalId (do not set it to anything)\nIn the body of the startCycle function, set cycleIntervalId to the value returned from setInterval\nNext, wrap the setInterval call in an if statement\nFor the if condition, check if cycleIntervalId is unset using !cycleIntervalId\nThis means there is not currently an interval running\n\n\n\nThis will not change any functionality yet, but it will now be possible to stop the interval. The added code should look something like this: \nlet cycleIntervalId;\n\nfunction startCycle() {\n  if (!cycleIntervalId) {\n    cycleIntervalId = setInterval(randomBgFilter, 250);\n  }\n}\n\nDefining the Stop Cycle Function and Hooking Up the Button\nAll that's left is to define a new function to stop the cycle, and hook it up to the proper button.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, define a new function named stopCycle\nIn the body of the stopCycle function, call the clearInterval function\nPass in cycleIntervalId to the clearInterval call\nThis will stop the startCycle function from running\n\n\nUnder that, still in the body, set the cycleIntervalId to null\nThis ensures that a new cycle will be able to start\n\n\nOutside the function definition, make a new line\nHook up the stopCycleButton to run the stopCycle function when clicked\nUse stopCycleButton.addEventListener\n\n\n\nRun the project, start the cycle, and make sure the \"Stop Cycle\" button makes it stop! The code at the bottom should look something like this:\nfunction stopCycle() {\n  clearInterval(cycleIntervalId);\n  cycleIntervalId = null;\n}\n\nstopCycleButton.addEventListener(\"click\", stopCycle);\n\nConclusion\nThis code-along showed a small sample of what is possible with event listeners and intervals.

Update the code so that instead of ending, it goes back to the start!\nAs an optional challenge, create a checkbox in the HTML that will determine whether or not to go back to the top.\nNow Playing Bar\nCurrently, the only way to see which track is playing is by which one has the \"Stop\" symbol. Add an area to the HTML that displays the current song title. It should update dynamically whenever a new song is playing, and it should disappear when no song is playing.\nHighlight Row When Playing\nAs an additional way to indicate a certain track is playing, highlight the associated row in the HTML whenever the song changes. No row should be highlighted when no song is playing.\nDouble Click Row to Play\nCurrently, the only way to play a track is to click the play button. Make it possible to play a track by double clicking anywhere on the row instead!\nShuffle\nCurrently, the songs should play in sequential order. Add an option that will play the tracks in a random order instead!\nPause\nCurrently, it is only possible to stop a track completely. If a song is stopped, it will start over when it is played again (instead of picking up where it left off). Add the ability to pause a track instead of stopping it completely.\nSUPER CHALLENGE: Reordering\nAdd the ability for a visitor to the site to reorder the playlist to their liking. This challenge will be quite difficult.\n"},"ArrowFunctions/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"ArrowFunctions/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 5 - Arrow Functions","keywords":"","body":"Arrow Functions\nLearn a new, shorter way to define functions!\nPowerPoint Presentation\n\n\nReview: Worksheet\nClick here to view the worksheet.\nCode-Along: Cereal Mascots For Some Reason\nClick here for the code-along starter code.\nClick here for the code-along instructions.\nSelf-Paced Work: Trading Card Updates\nClick here for the self-paced work instructions.\nResources\n\nJAVASCRIPT.INFO - Arrow functions, the basics\nW3Schools - Arrow Function\n\n"},"ArrowFunctions/Worksheet.html":{"url":"ArrowFunctions/Worksheet.html","title":"Worksheet","keywords":"","body":"\n"},"ArrowFunctions/MascotsCodeAlong.html":{"url":"ArrowFunctions/MascotsCodeAlong.html","title":"Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Code-Along: Cereal Mascots for Some Reason\nIn this code-along, create a website that showcases cereal mascot trading cards for some reason.\nSetting Up\nClick here to go to the Cereal Start project.\nStart by forking the Repl. There is a decent amount of starter code.\nHTML Starter Code\nThe index.html file has some basic elements, including:\n\nA  that calls a function named filterList when clicked\nA container  with an id of mascot-container\nA  that links to the style.css file\nA  that pulls from the script.js file\nThis is at the bottom of the  element so that it runs deferred\n\n\n\nCSS Starter Code\nThere is quite a bit of CSS code in the style.css file - most of this is to make card flipping work later. Do not worry too much about it, but know there is a .flipped selector that will be of great importance.\nJavaScript Starter Code\nThere is one variable in the script.js file - mascots. This is an array containing objects, each object with some properties about a different cereal mascot. This code-along is all about displaying that data in an engaging way!\nImages\nAlso of note, there are some images in the images folder. The image filenames are referenced by the mascots objects (e.g., tony.png).\nBeginning\nThere is a lot of setup, but nothing is actually functional yet. Run the project and notice that no mascots appear!\nName Cards: Text\nThe first step is to simply display the names of each mascot in the mascots array. This will be possible using the map function, and the forEach function.\nThe Basics\nStart by defining and calling the function.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAt the bottom, define a new function named displayCards\nUnder the definition, call the function\n\nIt won't do anything yet, but here's how the code should look:\nfunction displayCards() {\n\n}\n\ndisplayCards();\n\nMapping the Data\nThe next step is fairly involved, even though it only ends up being a single line of code. There is a lot of background information before the actual code appears - make sure it is fully understood!\nBackground: Getting Text Nodes\nEach piece of data from the mascots array should be converted into an HTML text node containing its name. To explain this, start by thinking about how that would be possible for a single mascot object. Here's an example:\nlet tony = {\n  name: \"Tony the Tiger\",\n  cereal: \"Frosted Flakes\",\n  image: \"tony.png\",\n  type: \"animal\",\n  description: \"Tony began to be humanized in the 1970s...\"\n}\n\nThe name could be stored in another variable, like this:\nlet tonyName = tony.name;\n\nThat could be converted into a text node like this:\nlet tonyNode = document.createTextNode(tonyName);\n\nNow, because there are multiple mascots, each piece of text can end with a dot to separate them. Instead of simply tonyName, the text could be a template literal like this:\nlet tonyText = `${tonyName}. `;\n\nSo, to put it all together, if there were an object like tony, it could be converted into a text node like this:\nlet tonyTextNode = document.createTextNode(`${tony.name}. `);\n\nBackground: Getting Text Nodes Function\nIn order to actually use this process on every element in mascots, it will be necessary to convert the \"text-node-ification\" of an object into a function. The function should take in a mascot object, and return a text node. A good old-fashioned function declaration might look something like this:\nfunction mascotToNode(mascot) {\n  let mascotTextNode = document.createTextNode(`${mascot.name}. `);\n  return mascotTextNode;\n}\n\nThat's functional, but an expression could be cleaner. Converting that function declaration into an anonymous function could go something like this:\n// remove name\nfunction (mascot) {\n  let mascotTextNode = document.createTextNode(`${mascot.name}. `);\n  return mascotTextNode;\n}\n\n// replace 'function' with '=>'\n(mascot) => {\n  let mascotTextNode = document.createTextNode(`${mascot.name}. `);\n  return mascotTextNode;\n}\n\n// simplify body\n(mascot) => {\n  return document.createTextNode(`${mascot.name}. `);\n}\n\n// remove curly brackets and use implicit return\n(mascot) => document.createTextNode(`${mascot.name}. `);\n\n// shorten parameter name\n(m) => document.createTextNode(`${m.name}. `);\n\n// remove parameter parentheses\nm => document.createTextNode(`${m.name}. `);\n\nAnd there we have it! A clear, concise function expression that takes a mascot with a name and turns it into a text node!\nActually Mapping the Data to Text Nodes\nNow that there's a function to create a text node from one object, it should be possible to create text nodes for all objects. It is possible with map! It's time to get back into the actual code!\n\nIn the body of the displayCards function, name a new line\nThere, define a new variable named mascotsHtml\nSet mascotsHtml to a call to mascots.map\nRemember, the passed function will run on each element in mascots\nThe results will be stored in the mascotsHtml variable\n\n\nBetween the ( and ), pass in the function expression from above m => document.createTextNode(`${m.name}. `);\n\n\n\nThat's it! Now, there is an array that contains a bunch of text nodes, one for each piece of data. It should look something like this:\nlet mascotsHtml = mascots.map(m => document.createTextNode(`${m.name}. `));\n\nAdding the Text to the Page\nNow that there are a bunch of nodes, it will be necessary to throw them into the container.\nGetting the Container\nThe first step is to grab the container from the HTML, and store it in a JavaScript variable.\n\nMake a new line in the displayCards function body\nCreate a new variable named container\nSet container to a call to document.querySelector\nPass in '#mascot-container' to grab \n\nThe line should look something like this:\nlet container = document.querySelector(\"#mascot-container\");\n\nAppending Each Node\nNext, use forEach to call appendChild on each node in the mascotsHtml array!\n\nMake a new line in the body of the displayCards function\nCall forEach on the mascotsHtml variable\nPass in an arrow function expression that takes one parameter: m\nIn the body of the expression, call container.appendChild on m\n\nThe line should look something like this:\nmascotsHtml.forEach(m => container.appendChild(m));\n\nTesting\nNow, run the project and see what happens! It should create text nodes from all the objects in the mascots array, and append them all to the . The added code in the script.js file should end up looking something like this:\nfunction displayCards() {\n  let mascotsHtml = mascots.map(m => document.createTextNode(`${m.name}. `));\n\n  let container = document.querySelector(\"#mascot-container\");\n  mascotsHtml.forEach(m => container.appendChild(m));\n}\n\ndisplayCards();\n\nName Cards: Cards\nAlright, so the site doesn't look great so far. It's just some text. We want each mascot to have their own card because that would be great for them. To start, create cards that simply have the name of each mascot. It will use an actual HTML  element instead of simply a text node.\n\nFind the mascots.map line in the displayCards function\nAdd curly brackets to the function expression\nRemove the body of the function expression, so it becomes m => { }\nMake a new line between { and }\nThere, create a new variable named mascotCard\nSet mascotCard to a call to document.createElement(\"div\")\nThis will be the actual card!\n\n\nUnder that, set the textContent of mascotCard to be m.name\nFinally, return mascotCard\nNote that return is required because there are { and }\n\n\n\nThe updated code should look something like this:\nlet mascotsHtml = mascots.map(m => {\n  let mascotCard = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  mascotCard.textContent = m.name;\n\n  return mascotCard;\n});\n\nRun the project again, and verify that the names are displayed on cards!\nTrading Cards: HTML\nOkay, it's starting to come together a little bit. But... each card should have so much more. Each card should display:\n\nThe picture\nThe name\nThe cereal\n\nEach card should also flip over on click, revealing the description on the back. How is this possible????\nAn Example\nTo see how this will look, there is some HTML to copy:\n\n  \n    \n    Tony the Tiger\n    Frosted Flakes\n  \n  Tony began to be humanized in the 1970s...\n\n\nPaste that into the container :\n\n\n\n\nRun the project to see how it looks! The goal will be to programmatically write up all that HTML for each element in the array.\nTrading Cards: Breaking Out the Function\nThis could get a little complex, so it will actually be a little easier to move the \"mascot-card-creation\" function expression somewhere else. This is not strictly necessary, but should make the code easier to write and maintain.\n\nNote: this is an example of refactoring: the functionality should actually stay the same for now, but it will be easier to improve it later!\n\nMoving\nStart by pulling the function expression code out of the map.\n\nIn the body of displayCards, find the mascots.map call\nCut the whole function parameter expression\nThis means copy it and delete it\n\n\nPaste it above the displayCards function\n\nAt this point, the code should look something like this:\nm => {\n  let mascotCard = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  mascotCard.textContent = m.name;\n\n  return mascotCard;\n};\n\nfunction displayCards() {\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nNaming\nNext, in order to actually use this function expression, it needs to be stored somewhere!\n\nDefine a new variable named objectToCard\nSet it to the function expression\nAdd a semi-colon at the end\n\nIt should look like this:\nlet objectToCard = m => {\n  let mascotCard = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  mascotCard.textContent = m.name;\n\n  return mascotCard;\n};\n\nPassing\nNow, all that's left is to pass that function into the map function! This will run it on every element in the mascots array, and convert them all into HTML objects.\n\nFind the mascots.map function call\nBetween the parentheses, pass the function variable (objectToCard)\n\nIt should look something like this:\nlet mascotsHtml = mascots.map(objectToCard);\n\nRun the project again, and verify that the cards still appear as they did before!\nTrading Cards: Data to HTML\nNow it's time to update that objectToCard function so that it creates better cards.\nStatic HTML\nStart by replacing every card with the raw HTML from before, containing the information about Tony the Tiger.\n\nFind the objectToCard function expression body\nRemove the line that sets the textContent\nIn its place, create a new variable named cardHTML\nSet cardHTML to a new template literal, and make some new lines between the backticks\nFor now, paste in the HTML from within the containing  above\nTwo  elements, the first with an , , and \nNote: Do not copy the containing  element!!\n\n\nUnder that, set the innerHTML property of the mascotCard object to be cardHTML\n\nThe updated code in the body of the objectToCard should now look something like this:\nlet cardHTML = `\n  \n    \n    Tony the Tiger\n    Frosted Flakes\n  \n  Tony began to be humanized in the 1970s...\n`;\n\nmascotCard.innerHTML = cardHTML;\n\nRun the project again. Now, you should see your website with all tonys. It's pretty close - just needs the specific data!\nDynamic HTML\nLuckily, each time objectToCard is called, there is a parameter that has all the data for each individual mascot. This is all stored in the m object, under m.image, m.name, m.cereal, and m.description. Using ${expression} notation, it will be possible to put this data into the HTML!\n\nFind the cardHTML template string (between backticks), and get ready to update it\nReplace tony.png with ${m.image}\nReplace Tony the Tiger with ${m.name}\nReplace Frosted Flakes with ${m.cereal}\nReplace Tony began to be humanized in the 1970s... with ${m.description}\n\nThe updated code should end up looking something like this:\nlet cardHTML = `\n  \n    \n    ${m.name}\n    ${m.cereal}\n  \n  ${m.description}\n  `\n\nNow, each run through the function will pull directly from the mascots array data! Run the project again, and verify that each mascot has their own card.\nTrading Cards: Flipping\nThe cards are looking great! You know what's even cooler than the cards are looking great? The cards should be able to flip when clicked. This will be possible using addEventListener, and another arrow function expression.\n\nFind the body of the objectToCard function expression\nMake a new line under the mascotCard.innerHTML line\nThere, call mascotCard.addEventListener\nFor the first argument, pass in \"click\"\nFor the second argument, create a new arrow expression\nStart with empty parentheses: ()\nThen, the arrow symbol: =>\nThen, curly brackets: {}\n\n\nClick between { and } and press enter to make a new line\nThere, call the mascotCard.classList.toggle function\nThis will add a class if it's not there, and remove it if it is\n\n\nPass in \"flipped\" as the argument\nThis class controls the CSS determining whether a card is flipped or not\n\n\n\nThe added code should look something like this: \nmascotCard.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  mascotCard.classList.toggle(\"flipped\");\n});\n\nRun the project again, and verify that the cards all flip over and show the mascot descriptions when you click them!\nFiltering the Cards\nEverything is looking pretty great now! But there is still the matter of that non-functional \"Filter\" button. It should be able to filter the cards shown based on their type property. This may not seem like a big deal now, but if there were 100 mascots, it would be very useful!\nParameterization\nRight now, every time the displayCards function runs, it uses the mascots array to show the cards. This will not work if we do not always want to use that array! The first step is to parameterize the displayCards function so that it can display any array of mascots.\n\nFind the displayCards function definition\nBetween the parentheses, add mascotsArray as a parameter\nIn the body, replace mascots with mascotsArray\nFind where displayCards is called\nThere, between the parentheses, add mascots\n\nThe updated code should end up looking something like this:\nfunction displayCards(mascotsArray) {\n  let mascotsHtml = mascotsArray.map(objectToCard);\n  // ...rest of body ...\n}\n\ndisplayCards(mascots);\n\nNote that this will not change anything... yet!\nPrompting on Button Click\nNext, hook up the button to a basic function that uses prompt to ask for a type by which to filter. Note that the button has an onclick that calls a function named filterList - but it has not been defined!\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, define a new function named filterList\nMake a new line in the body of the filterList function\nThere, create a new variable named type\nSet type to the result of a prompt call\nFor the prompt call, pass in \"What type of mascot do you want to see?\"\n\nThe code for the new filterList function should look something like this so far:\nfunction filterList() {\n  let type = prompt(\"What type of mascot do you want to see?\");\n}\n\nRun the project, click the \"Filter\" button, and verify that the prompt appears!\nDisplaying the Specific Cards\nThe function now knows what type of mascot to display, but... it's not doing anything with that information. Use the filter array method to narrow down the mascots, and then use displayList to display them!\n\nMake a new line under the type variable in the body of the filterList function\nThere, create a new variable named filteredList\nSet filteredList to be a call to mascots.filter\nFor the filter argument, create a new arrow function expression\nStart with a parameter: m (this is the current mascot)\nNext, the arrow: =>\nNo curly brackets needed\n\n\nIn the body of the function expression, check if m.type is equal to type\nThis way, only mascots with the same type property as the user entered will be in the resulting array!\nNote the implicit return - it's already returning a boolean, so the conditional expression is all that's needed\n\n\nOn the next line, call the displayCards function, and pass in filteredList\n\nThe code should end up looking something like this:\nlet filteredList = mascots.filter(m => m.type === type);\ndisplayCards(filteredList);\n\nRun the project, click the \"Filter\" button, and... maybe something is wrong? Yes, something is wrong! The new cards should be appended correctly, but the old ones are still there!\nClearing the Container\nEvery time the displayList function is called, any existing cards should be removed before the new ones are added.\n\nFind the displayList function\nFind the line where container is defined\nMake a new line under that\nThere, set the innerHTML of the container object to be empty\nMake sure this happens above the mascotsHtml.forEach!\n\n\n\nThe new line should look like this:\ncontainer.innerHTML = \"\";\n\nNow it should work! Try to filter the cards, and make sure it works 😊\nConclusion\nBy the end of the activity, the added code in the script.js file should look something like this:\n// A function to create an HTML \"card\" element from a mascot object\nlet objectToCard = m => {\n  // First create a \n  let mascotCard = document.createElement(\"div\");\n\n  // Add all the HTML text to show the image, name, cereal, and description\n  let cardHTML = `\n    \n      \n      ${m.name}\n      ${m.cereal}\n    \n    ${m.description}\n    `\n\n  // Set the inner HTML of the element\n  mascotCard.innerHTML = cardHTML;\n\n  // Flip the card when it is clicked (toggle the .flipped selector)\n  mascotCard.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n    mascotCard.classList.toggle(\"flipped\");\n  });\n\n  // Return the HTML\n  return mascotCard;\n};\n\n// A function to display a given array of mascot objects\nfunction displayCards(mascotsArray) {\n  // Convert ALL the mascots from the array into HTML Elements\n  let mascotsHtml = mascotsArray.map(objectToCard);\n\n  // Get the containing element\n  let container = document.querySelector(\"#mascot-container\");\n  container.innerHTML = \"\";\n\n  // Append each child to the container\n  mascotsHtml.forEach(m => container.appendChild(m));\n}\n\n// Display the full list to start!\ndisplayCards(mascots);\n\n// A function that displays a filtered list\nfunction filterList() {\n  // Get what type of mascot to display\n  let type = prompt(\"What type of mascot do you want to see?\");\n\n  // filter the list by type\n  let filteredList = mascots.filter(m => m.type === type);\n\n  // display the filtered list\n  displayCards(filteredList);\n}\n\n"},"ArrowFunctions/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"ArrowFunctions/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: Trading Card Updates\nFollow these instructions to update the trading card website.\nNew Trading Cards\nCurrently, all the trading cards display information about cereal mascots. If you're a big fan of cereal mascots, that's gr-r-reat! You can add more mascots. If not, you can make entirely new types of trading cards.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the mascots array definition at the top\nAdd at least three new objects\nMake sure to upload pictures for them into the images/ folder!\n\n\nUpdate any of the existing objects as desired\n\nHere are some other ideas for types of trading cards:\n\nSoccer Players Or Other Athletes\nPokemon or Digimon\nMusic Artists Or Bands\nYour Own Friends\nAny Characters From Anything At All\n\nTry to have some fun with it!\nNew Styles\nCurrently, the theme is very yellow-orange looking. Feel free to update the colors, fonts, borders, or any other styles!\nType on Card\nCurrently, each object should contain a type property - but this is actually not shown anywhere. Display it on the front of each card.\nThe type can be shown within a  element (under the cereal name) like so:\nType: animal\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the objectToCard function expression\nWithin the body, find the cardHTML variable\nIn the HTML text, add a  under the existing \nMake the text within the  say Type:\nAfter the colon, add the code to insert the type for the given mascot\n\nThat should be it! Run the project, and very that the type appears on each card.\nCards Unfiltered\nCurrently, after the list has been filtered, there is no way to get back to an unfiltered view of cards. Update the filter so that it is possible to show all cards again! This should happen if the user enters \"all\" when prompted.\nThere are a number of ways to do this. Try to figure out the simplest way!\nSearch Box\nThe filter is cool, but what if someone wanted to search by the name of the mascot? There should be a way to do that!\nHTML & CSS\nStart by creating a new label, text box, and button in the index.html file. Here is a basic rundown of the new elements that must be added:\n\nA piece of text of some kind indicating that the user should enter a \"name\" in the text box box\nAn  with an id attribute set to \"name\"\nThis is so that its value can be retrieved by the JavaScript\n\n\nA  with an onclick attribute that calls a function named filterByName\nThis is so that the list can be filtered when this button is clicked\nThe button should have text that indicates it can be clicked to filter\n\n\n\nIt does not have to look perfect, but it may be a good idea to update some CSS so that the label, text box, and button look nice on the page.\nJavaScript\nThe actual functionality can be added via JavaScript. This will look very similar to the filterList function.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line at the bottom of the file\nThere, define a new function named filterByName\nIn the body of the function, define a new variable named nameElement\nSet nameElement to be a call to document.querySelector\nThis should grab the \n\n\nCreate a new variable named name\nSet name to be the nameElement's value\nUnder that, create a new variable named filteredList\nSet filteredList to be a call to mascots.filter\nFor the filter argument, create a new arrow function expression\nStart with the parameter m\nThen the arrow: =>\n\n\nFor the arrow function body, check if m.name is equal to name\nFinally, call the displayCards function and pass in filteredList\n\nThis should be all that's necessary for a functioning search box! Run the project, enter a full name (with correct capitalization), and verify that only that result appears!\nSearch Box: Starts With\nThe search box is somewhat helpful, but it only works if the user enters the exact name of the mascot. Fix this so that it ignores capitalization, and also only checks if the name starts with the search term.\nThere will be a couple useful string functions for this:\n\ntoLowerCase\nstartsWith\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the filterByName function definition\nIn the body, find the function expression passed into mascots.filter\nAdd curly brackets to the arrow function expression\nIn the body (between the new { and }), make a new line\nThere, create a new variable named nameLc\nSet nameLc to be the name from the text box in all lowercase\nUnder that, create a new variable named mNameLc\nSet mNameLc to be the mascot's name in all lowercase\nUnder that, create a new variable named nameStartsWith\nSet nameStartsWith to check if mNameLc starts with the letters from nameLc\nUse a return statement to return the nameStartsWith variable value\n\nThat should be it! Test out the function to make sure it returns the properly filtered list. \nSearch Box: On Text Changed\nThis is working pretty well! But it may get annoying to keep clicking that \"Filter by Name\" button. Luckily, it is possible to automatically run a function whenever text is input.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line at the bottom of the file\nCreate a new variable named nameElement\nStore the  in the nameElement variable\nCall addEventListener on nameElement\nPass in \"input\" as the first argument\nFor the second argument, create a new arrow function expression\nStart with parentheses: ()\nThen the arrow symbol: =>\nThen curly brackets: {}\n\n\nMake a new line within the curly brackets\nThere, call the filterByName function\n\nRun the project and see how it works! When text is entered in the \"name\" box, the list should filter automatically.\nSearch Box: Refactoring and Updating\nThe search box is working, but there are a few updates that might make it better:\n\nIt should not have to get the nameElement variable more than once\nIt should filter by text in any part of the name (not just the beginning)\nThe \"Filter by Name\" button can be removed\nThe text box should look nicer\nIt could check against cereal in addition to name\nIt could check against description and type as well\nThere could be multiple fields for the different object properties\n\nThere are a ton of other possible enhancements - try to improve the site in any way you can!\n"},"MidSemesterReview/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"MidSemesterReview/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 6 - Mid-Semester Review","keywords":"","body":"Mid-Semester Review\nUse this session to review the concepts covered so far!\nOptions\nYou can choose from a number of options:\n\n🥣 Work on the self-paced work from the previous lesson\n🐜 Fix some bugs\n💪 Complete some challenges\n📚 Expand your knowledge\n🛵 Kickstart your project\n\n"},"MidSemesterReview/BugFixing.html":{"url":"MidSemesterReview/BugFixing.html","title":"Bug Fixing","keywords":"","body":"Bug Fixing\nFind and fix all the issues with these projects.

It follows this process:\n\nGrab the  from the HTML\nStored in a variable named itemContainer\n\n\nUse forEach to loop through every element in the items parameter array, and for each item value...\nCreate a new  element, stored in a variable named itemElement\nSet the innerHTML of itemElement to contain:\nAn  pointing to the item's picture\nA  with the item's name, and a plus button in a \nA  with the item's description\n\n\nGrab the newly created +, stored in the plusButton variable\nUse addEventListener to handle \"click\" events on the plusButton by...\nCalling the addItemToCart function on item!\n\n\nFinally, append the new itemElement to the itemContainer\n\n\n\nThis function will be called once, just as the page loads!\nThe viewCart Function\nUnder the buildMenu function, there is a function named viewCart. This is the most complex of the functions in the script.js file. It displays a table with every item in the cart array. There are many different parts to this function.\nCart  Setup\nThe top of the function prepares the HTML  element. It follows this process:\n\nGrab the  from the HTML\nStored in a variable named cartContainer\n\n\nSet the innerHTML of the cartContainer to include...\nA \nA  within the \n elements within the  for Item, Price, Quantity, and Total\n\n\nGrab the newly created , stored in the cartTable variable\n\nNow the cartTable is ready for item rows!\nLooping Through the cart with forEach\nThe next part of the function loops through each item value in the cart, and adds a row to the table for each one. It follows this process:\n\nCreate a new  element, stored in a variable named itemRow\nCorrectly format the price in the itemPrice variable\nCalculate the total for the row, stored in the itemTotal variable\nSet the innerHTML of the itemRow to include...\nA  for the item's name\nA  for the item's price\nA  for the item's quantity\nA  for the item's total\n\n\nFinally, append the new itemRow to the cartTable\n\nBy this point, every item is in the table - but it's not done just yet!\nAdding the Final Cart Table Row\nThere will be one row of the cart table that includes the total of all items together. This part follows this process:\n\nCreate a new  element, stored in a variable named finalRow\nUse reduce to sum up the grand total of all the items together (grandTotal)\nThis takes a function with two parameters: the total, and the next item\nThe total from the next item is added to the total, and then returned\n\n\n0 is passed as the starter value for the total\nNote: This is an advanced topic, so don't worry too much about fully grasping it!\n\n\nSet the innerHTML of the finalRow to include...\nA bolded  saying \"Total\"\nA bolded  containing the totalCost\n\n\nFinally, append the finalRow to the cartTable\n\nThat's all! The  in the HTML will now contain a header row, a row for each item, and a final row. The viewCart function is called every time a new item is added to the cart.\nThe End\nThe last thing to do is to call buildMenu on the sandwiches array - this adds all the sandwiches (as well as their plus buttons) to the page!\nThere is quite a bit of code, but learning how to navigate and update existing code (even if it's a little difficult to understand) is an incredibly valuable skill to learn. Try to complete some of these challenges to practice.\nChallenge 1: More Sandwiches\nCurrently, there are only three sandwiches. This is a pretty weak offering. Update the initial sandwiches array to include at least two (2) new items!\nWhat to Add\nThere are already images for a Club Sandwich (images/club.jpg) and a Veggie Sandwich (images/veg.jpg) built into the project. However, this menu can contain anything you would like! Feel free to change it up and offer entirely new options as desired. They don't even have to be food items!\nChallenge 2: Menu Item Prices\nCurrently, the menu displays the name, picture, and description for each item. However, the price is not displayed anywhere! Update the itemElement HTML to include each item's price!\nWhere to Add the Price\nThere are a few different ways to display the price. For example, it could look be added within parentheses at the end of the description:\n\nThe important thing is add the dollar sign, and try to make it stand out a little bit. Play around and see what looks good!\nChallenge 3: Removal Button\nCurrently, once an item has been added to the cart, there is no way to remove it. This may be good for business, but customers may not like it very much. Add a removal button to each menu item that will remove the item from the cart!\nThere are a few ways to do this, but the ultimate goal is to have a - button next to the + button that will reduce the quantity of the given item in the cart by 1. If it exists...\nAdded Challenge: Dynamic Display\nFor the base of this challenge, the - button could be displayed regardless of how many items are in the cart. As an added challenge, try to show the - button only when there is at least one of the item in the cart.\nChallenge 4: Cart Quantity Updates\nThis challenge may involve a fair amount of additional work. Currently, the Quantity of each item in the cart is displayed as a static number. Turn each Quantity cell into a dynamic, update-able value. It could look something like this:\n\nNote that with every quantity update, the cart (and total price calculations) should update as well.\nChallenge 5: Cart Storage\nThe site is coming together, but what if a customer accidentally closes out of the page before they checkout??????? What would we do???? All their hard work of building their cart would be gone!!!!!!!!\nLuckily, there is a way to persist data locally.\nBackground: Local Storage\nThis is possible using something called localStorage - it's basically a way to store data in the browser for a given user. This can make basic front-end web applications much more powerful!\nlocalStorage has two main functions: storing values (setting), and retrieving values (getting).\nSetting an Item\nSetting an item looks like this:\nlet myValue = \"This will be stored\";\n\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"myValue\", myValue);\n\nGetting an Item\nIf an item has already been stored, you can get it like this:\nlet myValue = localStorage.getItem(\"myValue\");\n\nChallenge\nUpdate the project so that instead of storing everything in a local cart variable, all the data is stored in a localStorage item.\n"},"MidSemesterReview/Library.html":{"url":"MidSemesterReview/Library.html","title":"Library","keywords":"","body":"Library\nFeel free to browse through these resources.\nGeneral Library\nClick here to check out the library of general interest.\nJavaScript Articles\nHere are some articles to read about JavaScript.\n\nDEV: A Brief History of JavaScript\nWikipedia: JavaScript\n\n"},"ApiConsumption/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"ApiConsumption/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 7 - Consuming an API","keywords":"","body":"Consuming an API\nThis lesson is all about grabbing real data from the internet, and using it to create dynamic web experiences.\nThis is made possible by APIs!\nWarm-Up: Query Styles\nClick here for the warm-up instructions.\nPowerPoint Presentation: API Concepts\n\n\nPowerPoint Presentation: Using an API\n\n\nCode-Along: Dog Fetcher\nClick here for the code-along starter code.\nClick here for the code-along instructions.\nSelf-Paced Work: Dog Fetcher Updates\nClick here for the self-paced work instructions.\nResources\n\nPublic APIs Repository\nDictionary API Example Project\nJAVASCRIPT.INFO: Fetch\n\"Requests\" by John K.

Fork the project to begin the activity.\nPart One: Background\nTypically, dogs play fetch. In this activity, your code is going to be playing fetch, and the things that your code will be fetching will be dogs!\n\nThe Starter Code\nThe starter project has quite a bit of code, but it's all HTML and CSS! In the index.html file, there are a few elements of note:\n\nAn  with an id of \"num-dogs\"\nA  with an onclick of \"getDogs()\"\nAn  with an id of \"loading\"\nThis is currently hidden using CSS\n\n\nA  with an id of \"dog-imgs\"\n\nAll of these elements will be necessary to make the website functional.\nThe shibe.online API\nThe code needs something to fetch, and luckily, there is an API that provides random pictures of shiba inu dogs! These adorable pups are also known as \"shibes\" in internet parlance - hence the name, shibe.online. Take a look at the homepage to learn more about how the API works.\nThe base url is https://shibe.online/api/shibes. For the purposes of this activity, the only relevant query parameter will be count. The response will be a JSON array of strings; each one a URL pointing to a picture of a shibe.\nPutting it all together, here's an example URL: https://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=3\nThe response should look something like this:\n[\n  \"https://cdn.shibe.online/shibes/039e86853cb65ed16cb3823a4fd9528ae374cfec.jpg\",\n  \"https://cdn.shibe.online/shibes/6179b94f4e16762f29e69b48a45f16372b11ed72.jpg\",\n  \"https://cdn.shibe.online/shibes/e0419f6e1f00e800bada84233b0bad86723077ed.jpg\"\n]\n\nTry opening one of the URLs to see the picture! Here is one of them:\n\nThe Plan\nTo utilize this API, the code should:\n\nMake a request to the base URL using fetch\nUse the  to determine the count to pass in as a query parameter\n\n\nExtract the image URLs from the response\nCreate new  elements, one for each URL returned\n\nPart Two: Button Begins 🦇\nCurrently, there is no JavaScript code in the project. That's bad! Start things off by hooking up the  with a new function definition.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nDefine a new function named getDogs\nIn the body of the function, create a new variable named loadingImg\nSet loadingImg to grab the  picture\nUse document.querySelector for this\n\n\nOn the next line, set the style.display of the image to \"inline-flex\"\nThis will make the loading indicator appear\n\n\n\nAt this point, run the project, click the \"Get Dogs\" button, and verify that the loading indicator image appears! The code should look something like this:\nfunction getDogs() {\n  let loadingImg = document.querySelector(\"#loading\");\n  loadingImg.style.display = \"inline-flex\";\n}\n\nPart Three: Fetching Two Dogs 🐕🐕\nNow the button is ready, so it's time to try to get some dogs! To start, the code can ignore the  and just try to get two dogs.\nTrying to Fetch with fetch\nUse the fetch function to send a request out to the API to try to get some shibe pics.\n\nMake a new line in the body of the getDogs function\nCreate a new variable named response\nSet response to equal a call to fetch\nPass in `https://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=2` as the URL\n\n\nUnder that, create a variable named responseJson\nSet responseJson to a call to the json() function on the response variable\nFinally, call alert on responseJson to display the result\n\nWith that, run the code, click the \"Get Dogs\" button again, and see what happens. It might not quite work... it should display a pop-up, but there is an issue with this code:\nlet response = fetch(`https://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=2`);\nlet responseJson = response.json();\nalert(responseJson);\n\nCatching an Error with try/catch\nSo something is wrong, and it may be possible to debug it, but it is also possible for the code itself to catch the error! Use the try/catch structure to try to figure out what is happening.\n\nAbove the current variables, declare response and responseJson without giving them a value\nThis will allow the code to use them in and out of the try block\n\n\nUnder that, create a try/catch structure\nStart with the try keyword\nThen, add curly brackets { and }\nAfter that, add the catch\nFor the catch, add parentheses ( and )\nPut e within the parentheses to represent the error\nFinally, add another set of curly brackets { and }\n\n\nMove the original variable sets into the try block\nMake sure to get rid of the let because these already exist\n\n\nIn the catch block, call alert on the error\nAlso in the catch block, return from the function\n\nThe modified code should look something like this:\nlet response, responseJson;\n\ntry {\n  response = fetch(`https://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=2`);\n  responseJson = response.json();\n} catch (e) {\n  alert(e);\n  return;\n}\n\nNow, try running the project and clicking the button. It still will not work, but at least the error should appear in a pop-up! It should say the following:\nTypeError: response.json is not a function\nFixing the Error with Asynchronicity\nHmm... why would response.json not be a function? The fetch call should return a Response object... or should it? What does the fetch function return again?\nThe fetch function returns a Promise object - so it must be awaited to yield the actual result!\n\nStart by adding the async keyword to the getDogs function definition\nNext, add the await keyword in front of the fetch call\nAlso, add the await keyword in front of the json() call\nAdditionally, add a finally block after the catch block\nThere, make the loading indicator disappear\nUse .style.display = \"none\" to accomplish this\n\n\nAdditionally, for testing, purposes, call alert on responseJson\n\nRun the program, click the \"Get Dogs\" button again, and verify that some dog image URLs appear! Copy and paste one into a new tab to see a shibe like this.\nAt this point, the entire code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nasync function getDogs() {\n  let loadingImg = document.querySelector(\"#loading\");\n  loadingImg.style.display = \"inline-flex\";\n\n  let response, responseJson;\n\n  try {\n    response = await fetch(`https://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=2`);\n    responseJson = await response.json();\n  } catch (e) {\n    alert(e);\n    return;\n  } finally {\n    loadingImg.style.display = \"none\";\n  }\n\n  alert(responseJson);\n}\n\nPart Four: Displaying the Images\nThe fetch request is actually working! The JavaScript code is talking to an API and retrieving something from the internet. The next step is to display the results in a nicer way.\nPrepping the Container\nThere is already a  container in the index.html file - this will hold the new pictures of dogs. The first step will be to grab it, and clear out anything that's in it.\n\nRemove the alert from the body of the getDogs function\nIn its place, create a new variable named dogImgsDiv\nUse document.querySelector to grab the  and store it in the variable\nUnder that, set the innerHTML of the dogImgsDiv to be \"\"\n\nThe code for this part should look something like this:\nlet dogImgsDiv = document.querySelector(\"#dog-imgs\");\ndogImgsDiv.innerHTML = \"\";\n\nLooping the Response\nThe goal is to create one picture element for each picture URL in the response. The responseJson object should be an array that stores something like this:\n[\"https://cdn.shibe.online/shibes/9e5687af188a54e801762da4ee920f870e3db633.jpg\",\"https://cdn.shibe.online/shibes/3e918c16e267262d9affef660758b76368f49125.jpg\"]\nThe forEach array function will be perfect for this! First, establish the loop.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the getDogs function\nThere, call the forEach() function on responseJson\nBetween the parentheses, create a new arrow function\nIt should have one parameter: dogUrl\nIt should have an arrow: =>\nIt should have curly brackets: { and }\n\n\n\nThe loop code should look something like this:\nresponseJson.forEach(dogUrl => {});\n\nAdding Each Image to the Container\nNow the code is setup to run a block for every image URL retrieved from shibe.online. For each of them, a new  element should be created and added to the dogImgsDiv container!\n\nWithin the forEach arrow function body, make a new line\nThere, create a new variable named newDogImg\nSet newDogImg to be a new \"img\" element using document.createElement\nUnder that, set the src of newDogImg to the dogUrl value\nUnder that, append the newDogImg element to the dogImgsDiv element\nUse appendChild to accomplish this\n\n\n\nRun the project, click the \"Get Dogs\" button, and verify that the dog images actually appear now! Click it a few times to see some different pairs of dogs. The code in the body of the arrow function should look something like this:\nlet newDogImg = document.createElement(\"img\");\nnewDogImg.src = dogUrl;\ndogImgsDiv.appendChild(newDogImg);\n\nPart Five: Dynamic Number of Dogs\nThe final step is to actually take into account the text box - this will allow the user to grab a specific number of shibes!\n\nMake a new line above the let response, responseJson line in the body of the getDogs function\nThere, create a new variable named numDogsInput\nSet numDogsInput to be the  element\nUse document.querySelector\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named numDogs\nSet numDogs to be the value of the numDogsInput element\nFind the fetch call\nIn the fetch URL, replace the 2 with the interpolated numDogs value\nUse ${numDogs}\n\n\n\nRun the project, enter a number of dogs, click the \"Get Dogs\" button, and verify that the proper number of dogs appears!\nConclusion\nWow. There sure are some dogs in that API! In this activity, the code used fetch to grab data from an API (using an HTTP GET request) and display images from it.\nBy the end of the code-along, the script.js file should look something like this:\nasync function getDogs() {\n  let loadingImg = document.querySelector(\"#loading\");\n  loadingImg.style.display = \"inline-flex\";\n\n  let numDogsInput = document.querySelector(\"#num-dogs\");\n  let numDogs = numDogsInput.value;\n\n  let response, responseJson;\n\n  try {\n    response = await fetch(`https://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=${numDogs}`);\n    responseJson = await response.json();\n  } catch (e) {\n    alert(e);\n    return;\n  } finally {\n    loadingImg.style.display = \"none\";\n  }\n\n  let dogImgsDiv = document.querySelector(\"#dog-imgs\");\n  dogImgsDiv.innerHTML = \"\";\n\n  responseJson.forEach(dogUrl => {\n    let newDogImg = document.createElement(\"img\");\n    newDogImg.src = dogUrl;\n    dogImgsDiv.appendChild(newDogImg);\n  });\n}\n\nNext Steps\nClick here to see how you can make more updates to the Dog Fetcher site!\n"},"ApiConsumption/DogFetcherSelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"ApiConsumption/DogFetcherSelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: Dog Fetcher Updates\nFollow these instructions to make some updates to the Dog Fetcher website.\n🐦 Birds & Cats 🐈\nDogs are cool. Dogs are really cool. But it might be even cooler to show images of other animals too! Luckily, shibe.online has APIs for birds and cats in addition to dogs! Incorporate these into the Dog Fetcher site.\nBasic Challenge: Replace\nThe simple way to do this would be to replace the shibes URL with one that points to either birds or cats. Basically, the base URL should look something like this instead:\nhttps://shibe.online/api/birds\nUpdate the URL in the fetch call to grab images of a different kind of animal. Then, update all the HTML to reflect the new type of animal!\nAdvanced Challenge: Select\nThe more complex, but more rewarding, version of this challenge is to allow the user to select what type of animal they want to see. Dynamically update the URL based on whatever they want! Follow these steps:\nHTML\nMake these updates in the index.html file:\n\nChange everywhere it says \"dogs\" to say \"animals\" instead\nRight under the , add a new \nIn the , create a  asking \"What animal would you like to see?\"\nUnder the , add a  element\nIn the  element, add  elements for all of these:\nShibes\nBirds\nCats\n\n\nAdd an id attribute to the  so it is identifiable in JavaScript\nAdd value attributes to each  so they can be retrieved\n\nJavaScript\nMake these updates in the script.js file:\n\nUpdate all places where it says \"dogs\" to say \"animals\" instead, to match the HTML\nGet the selected animal option in the body of the function\nIn the fetch call URL, replace the shibes with the interpolated value from the selected option value\n\nNew Dog Breeds\nCurrently, the website only shows shiba inu dogs. This is a good thing, but some people might want other types of dogs as well. Luckily, this is possible... but it required the use of a different API.\nThe Dog CEO Dog API\nHead over to the Dog API page to see how to get random dogs of a variety of breeds! This is very similar to the shibe.online API, but it is a little different:\n\nThe base URL is https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random\nThere is no count query parameter\nInstead of an array, The response is a JSON object with a \"message\" property\nOnly one dog image is returned\n\nUpdate the code to use this new API instead of the shibe.online API!\nMore Customization\nAnother benefit of the Dog API is that it is actually possible to specify a breed in the request. There are a number of ways to work with this data.\n\nCheck out the Documentation for the API\nCheck out the BREEDS LIST page to see how these requests can be used\n\nChoose a few different breeds, and allow the user to select which dog breed they would like to see.\nEXTRA CHALLENGE: Locking Pictures\nThis is fun, but removing all the pictures every time new ones are retrieved is kind of sad. Figure out a way to keep around some of the  elements every time new images are grabbed! It should be possible for the user to select which pictures they would like to keep; all other pictures should be removed.\nNote: This challenge may be quite difficult.\n"},"ApiReviewExamples/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"ApiReviewExamples/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 8 - API Review & Examples","keywords":"","body":"API Review & Examples\nThis lesson is all about reviewing the material from the previous lesson.\nSelf-Paced Work: Dog Fetcher Updates\nClick here to continue working on the Dog Fetcher updates from the previous lesson.\nCode-Along: What Does the Cat Say?\nClick here for the code-along instructions.\nSelf-Paced Work: What Does the Cat Say Now?\nClick here for the self-paced work instructions.\nExamples\nThere are so many ways to use so many different APIs.

Not to be confused with The Fox.\nClick here to view the Cat Says Starter Repl project. Fork the project to begin the activity.\nPart One: Background\nBefore diving into the activity, take some time for research and planning.\nThe Starter Code\nThe starter project has quite a bit of code, but it's all HTML and CSS! In the index.html file, there are a few elements of note:\n\nAn  with an id of \"cat-message\"\nA  with an onclick of \"run()\"\nAn  with an id of \"cat-pic\"\n\nAll of these elements will be necessary to make the website functional.\nThe Cat as a Service API\nThe cataas API has a ton of different ways to access random cat pictures. One of its most powerful features is to embed messages right onto images. This is possible with the /cat/says/ endpoint.\nFor example, the URL to get a random cat saying \"hi\" would look like this: https://cataas.com/cat/says/hi\nNotice that the message hi is actually not a query parameter - it is simply part of the URL path! There is one query parameter to add, though: json=true. This will send along more information in JSON form that could end up being useful.\nFor example, the URL to get a random cat saying \"hi\" in JSON would look like this: https://cataas.com/cat/says/hi?json=true\nNote: Changing \"hi\" to any other message would make the new message appear on the image!\nThe response should look something like this:\n{\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"closed eyes\",\n    \"sleepy\",\n    \"bed\"\n  ],\n  \"createdAt\": \"2022-09-11T00:27:05.317Z\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"2022-10-11T07:52:32.756Z\",\n  \"validated\": true,\n  \"owner\": \"LeBonk\",\n  \"file\": \"631d2b59444de200102f10c9.jpeg\",\n  \"mimetype\": \"image/jpeg\",\n  \"size\": 384097,\n  \"_id\": \"2bPYDRuvU70sbgja\",\n  \"url\": \"/cat/2bPYDRuvU70sbgja/says/hi\"\n}\n\nFor the purposes of this activity, the important property will be the url - that can be appended to the base URL to retrieve the image!\nIt ends up looking something like this: https://cataas.com/cat/2bPYDRuvU70sbgja/says/hi\n\nThe Plan\nTo utilize this API, the code should:\n\nGrab the message from the text box  on the page\nUse fetch to request a random cat saying the message\nUse the base URL of https://cataas.com/cat/says/\nPass the message after the slash\nUse the json=true query parameter to get JSON data\n\n\nGrab the url property from the response\nSet the src of the  to be the returned URL\n\nPart Two: Hooking Up the Button\nFirst, define an asynchronous function to run when the button on the page is clicked.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nThere, define a new function named run to match the onclick of the \nAdd the async keyword in front of function to make it asynchronous\nIn the body of the function, create a new variable named catPic\nUse document.querySelector to store the  in the catPic variable\nUnder that, set the src of catPic to be a loading indicator image\nUse \"https://media.tenor.com/o8m3bKTsifUAAAAM/hold-on.gif\"\n\n\n\nRun the project, click the button, and verify that the loading indicator shows up! The code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nasync function run() {\n  let catPic = document.querySelector(\"#cat-pic\");\n  catPic.src = \"https://media.tenor.com/o8m3bKTsifUAAAAM/hold-on.gif\";\n}\n\nPart Three: Getting the Message\nThe next step is to grab the text from the text box, aka the  from the HTML.\n\nMake a new line in the body of the run function\nThere, create a new variable named messageInput\nUse document.querySelector to store the  in the messageInput from the HTMl\nUnder that, create a new variable named message\nStore the value of the messageInput element in the message variable\n\nFor testing purposes, throw an alert in the code to display the message result. Then, run the project, enter a message in the box, click the button, and verify that the message appears! Remove the alert after testing. The added code should end up looking something like this:\nlet messageInput = document.querySelector(\"#cat-message\");\nlet message = messageInput.value;\n\nPart Four: Catching Errors\nIn order to properly make an HTTP request in JavaScript, it is generally a good idea to wrap any call to fetch in a try/catch structure. Create this structure.\n\nMake a new line in the body of the run function\nThere, declare two variables without values: response and responseJson\nThese will be set in the try block\n\n\nUnder that, create a try/catch structure\ntry\ncurly brackets { and }\ncatch\nparentheses ()\ne within the parentheses for the error value\ncurly brackets { and }\n\n\nWithin the catch block, make a new line\nThere, set the src of catPic to be \"\"\nThis will remove the loading indicator\n\n\nUnder that, alert the error received\nUnder that, return from the function\n\nNothing will change, but now the code is ready for a fetch! The added lines should look something like this:\nlet response, responseJson;\n\ntry {\n} catch (e) {\n  catPic.src = \"\";\n  alert(e);\n  return;\n}\n\nPart Five: Making the Request\nNow it's time to actually involve the API with fetch! Make the request, and grab the JSON data.\n\nMake a new line in the try block within the run function\nThere, make a new variable named url\nSet url to be the a new template literal\nBetween the backticks, add the URL with the query parameter for the cat to say \"hi\"\nhttps://cataas.com/cat/says/hi?json=true\n\n\nReplace hi with the interpolated value of message using ${}\nhttps://cataas.com/cat/says/${message}?json=true\n\n\nUnder that, call fetch on the url variable value\nAdd an await in front of the fetch call to yield the response\nStore the result in the response variable\n\n\nUnder that, call response.json() to grab the JSON data in a promise\nAdd the await keyword in front of the .json() call to yield the JSON object\nStore the result in the responseJson variable\n\n\n\nFor testing purposes, throw an alert in the code to display the responseJson result. Then, run the project, enter a message in the box, click the button, and verify that the response JSON data appears! It should simply say [object Object], but that means it is in fact an object! Remove the alert after testing. The added code should end up looking something like this:\nlet url = `https://cataas.com/cat/says/${message}?json=true`;\nresponse = await fetch(url);\nresponseJson = await response.json();\n\nPart Six: Displaying the Image\nNow for the fun part. The response has come back, and the data is there - all that's left is to extract the image URL, append it to the base URL, and set it as the image source!\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the run function\nThere, create a new variable named imageUrl\nSet imageUrl to be the a new template literal\nBetween the backticks, add the base URL, without the slash at the end\nhttps://cataas.com\n\n\nAt the end of the literal, add the interpolated value of the response url property using ${}\nUnder that, set the src of the catPic element to be the imageUrl value\n\nRun the project, enter a message, click the button, and verify that a random cat appears with the message! The added code should look something like this:\nlet imageUrl = `https://cataas.com${responseJson.url}`;\ncatPic.src = imageUrl;\n\nConclusion\nBy the end of the code-along, the script.js file should look something like this:\nasync function run() {\n  let catPic = document.querySelector(\"#cat-pic\");\n  catPic.src = \"https://media.tenor.com/o8m3bKTsifUAAAAM/hold-on.gif\";\n\n  let messageInput = document.querySelector(\"#cat-message\");\n  let message = messageInput.value;\n\n  let response, responseJson;\n\n  try {\n    let url = `https://cataas.com/cat/says/${message}?json=true`;\n    response = await fetch(url);\n    responseJson = await response.json();\n  } catch (e) {\n    catPic.src = \"\";\n    alert(e);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  let imageUrl = `https://cataas.com${responseJson.url}`;\n  catPic.src = imageUrl;\n}\n\nNext Steps\nClick here to see how you can make more updates to the Cat Says site!\n"},"ApiReviewExamples/CatSaySelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"ApiReviewExamples/CatSaySelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: What Does the Cat Say Now?\nContinue to explore the cataas API with these exercises.\nGIFs Only\nIs it pronounced gif? Or is it gif? The world may never know. The one thing we can all agree on is that there are GIF images of cats on the internet. And luckily, the cataas API has a way to send them!\nDo some research to figure out how to limit images returned by the API to only GIFs.\nHint: the URLs should look something like https://cataas.com/cat/gif/says/meow?json=true.\nFor an added challenge, add a checkbox in the HTML to see if the user would like GIFs or all images, and add the /gif/ to the URL if the box is checked!\nCat Tags\nAnother cool thing the cataas API can do is search by tag. For example, to display only cats where \"cute\" is a tag, just add /cute before /says!\nDo some research and figure out how to find cats with certain tags.\nHint: the URLs should look something like https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/hi?json=true\nFor an added challenge, add another text box in the HTML, and allow the user to enter a tag. But what tags could they enter???\nAll Tags\nAmazingly, there is an cataas API endpoint that returns the complete list of tags for cat images. Go to https://cataas.com/api/tags to see the full list.\nThere are a few options here:\n\nCopy the current list into the script.js file directly, and use it to check before sending requests\nCreate a dropdown in the HTML with a few selected tags hard-coded into the page\nUse fetch to dynamically load up the full list of tags, and dynamically create a dropdown in the HTML so the user can choose between all available tags\n\nFeel free to use the tags however you'd like!\nCat Filters\nOne additional fun thing that can be appended to any URL is the use of image filters! These filters take an image and transform it in some way. There are several filters available:\n\nblur\nmono\nsepia\nnegative\npaint\npixel\n\nThe filter option is added to the URL as a query parameter! For example, a URL could look like this: https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/meow?json=true&filter=negative\nThere are some options here:\n\nAdd a default filter to every image returned\nAdd a random filter to every image returned\nAllow the user to select a filter to apply to the image\n\nFeel free to use filters however you'd like!\nMore\nThese are some of the options available, but it's up to you to make whatever you'd like.

Each picture corresponds to a set of weather codes. In the script.js file, these images are defined within the weatherCodeImages array.\nStart by adding more pictures for different types of weather! For example, right now, all \"rainy\" weather codes are grouped together - but there are specific codes that could have different images! This could be things like:\n\nDrizzling\nFreezing Rain\nPouring Down Rain\nThunderstorms\n\nThere are also some different options for snow - it could be heavy or light.\nPictures Based on Day/Night\nThis would be more of a challenge, but it could be cool. Figure out if it is daytime or nighttime in the current region, and adjust the images accordingly. For example, snow during the day could look like this:\n\nAnd snow during the night could look like this:\n\nThere could even be specific images for different types of cities (rural/urban, based on population), different temperatures (hot day v. cold day), and so on.\n_Note: the time is returned as part of the current_weather object.\nMore Location Information\nCurrently, when searching by zip code or city, the main name of the location is displayed on the page. However, there is a lot more information that could appear!\nWhen finding the data in the getDataFromSearchLocation function, the response contains several properties in addition to the latitude, longitude, and name. These include:\n\nadmin1 - state\nadmin2 - county\ncountry\nelevation\npopulation\npostcodes\n\nAdd some of this to the page!\nLoading Indicator\nCurrently, when entering a new search term, there is no indication that the page is waiting for a response. Add a loading indicator that appears before the request, and disappears after the request completes!\nHistorical Data\nIt could be cool to get some information about what weather was on this day one year ago - this is possible with the Historical Weather API!\nA request URL could look something like this (for the given latitude, longitude, and current date):\nhttps://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api#latitude=41.48&longitude=-81.80&start_date=2022-03-29&end_date=2022-03-29&daily=temperature_2m_max&timezone=auto&temperature_unit=fahrenheit\nFigure out how to get the current date in JavaScript, make the request, and add the data to the page!\nAPI Information\nThe Open-Meteo site has a ton of neat APIs that are capable of doing quite a few things.\nGeocoding API\nThe Geocoding API can get data about a location based on a search. This is used to turn the search term on the site into a latitude, longitude, and name.\nWeather Forecast API\nThe Weather Forecast API is a bit more complex - there are a ton of different parameters and features available. The current site only really cares about the current weather, but it is possible to get an hourly forecast, a daily forecast, information about precipitation, wind, soil moisture, sunrise, sunset... quite a bit of information.\nTry to play around with the URL builder a bit to see what type of data you can get. There's a ton of it!\nCode Information\nThe code is fairly substantial for this website. Most of the interesting bits are in the script.js file:\n\nweatherCodeImages: an array of objects, each mapping an image URL to a group of weather codes\ngetImageUrlForWeatherCode: a function that takes a weather code, and returns the image URL for that weather code\nsetBgFromWeatherCode: a function that takes a weather code, and sets the background image to the picture for the code\ngetDataFromSearchLocation: a function that takes a search term (e.g., \"44107\" or \"Los Angeles\"), and finds location information for the term including latitude and longitude\nThis uses the Geocoding API\n\n\ngetWeatherFromLatLng: a function that takes a latitude and longitude, and gets the current weather for the location\nThis uses the Weather Forecast API\n\n\ngetWeather: the function that runs when the \"Get Weather\" button is clicked; it grabs the value from the search box, finds the weather for the location, and displays it on the page\n\n"},"ApiReviewExamples/Examples/Trivia.html":{"url":"ApiReviewExamples/Examples/Trivia.html","title":"Trivia","keywords":"","body":"API Example: Trivia App\nThis site uses a Trivia API to grab some multiple choice questions and use them to quiz the user.\n\nPreview: https://trivia.hylandoutreach.repl.co\nProject: https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Trivia\nAPIs: Open Trivia Database\n\nImprovement Ideas\nAs it stands, this website is fairly basic. Here are some things that could make it better.\nOption Choices\nCurrently, the quiz will always be 5 questions, and they will always be \"easy\" questions. Add a way for the user to decide how many questions, and what difficulty to use! These are set as the numQuestions and difficulty variables in the startQuiz function.\nThe simple way to do this would be to use more prompt statements to ask the user to enter the information. The more powerful way would be to create a number text box and a difficulty dropdown on the HTML page, and then grab those values before making the request!\nCategories\nThe API also allows for specific categories of questions. These are listed on the API site; but it is also possible to get these categories from the API itself!\nCreate a way for the user to decide which category they would like. This could be a dropdown in the HTML, populated by an API request... or it could be another simple prompt. Note that the category passed in the URL is numeric.\nInteractive DOM\nCurrently, the site uses prompts to ask all the questions to the user. This is functional, but it is not a modern, user-friendly experience. Update the code so that the questions are added directly to the HTML, and the user is able to select their answer by clicking it. This may be a significant challenge, but the data should all be the same - it will not be necessary to update the API calls at all!\nQuiz Feedback\nCurrently, when the quiz completes, there is simply a raw score that appears. There is no way for the user to know which questions they answered correctly or incorrectly. Update the code so that it keeps track of which questions were correct and incorrect, and displays that information after the quiz completes! \nAPI Information\nThe Open Trivia Database API is one of the simpler ones. There are a few options available via query parameters, such as:\n\namount (number of questions)\ncategory (numeric value representing a variety of categories)\ndifficulty (\"easy\", \"medium\", or \"hard\")\ntype (\"multiple\" for multiple choice, \"boolean\" for true/false)\n\nThe URL could end up looking something like this: https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=2&category=25&difficulty=medium&type=multiple\nThe response will be something like this:\n{\n  \"response_code\": 0,\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Entertainment: Music\",\n      \"type\": \"multiple\",\n      \"difficulty\": \"hard\",\n      \"question\": \"This album, now considered to be one of the greatest of all time, was a commercial failure when it was released.\",\n      \"correct_answer\": \"The Velvet Underground and Nico\",\n      \"incorrect_answers\": [\n        \"Abbey Road\",\n        \"Led Zeppelin IV\",\n        \"Pet Sounds\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThe questions are within the results property, which contains an array of question objects. Each question object has a question property with the question text, a correct_answer property with the correct answer, and an incorrect_answers property which is an array of strings, each one a different incorrect answer to the question.\nCode Information\nThe code is organized into a few different functions and variables in the script.js file.\n\nANSWER_LETTERS: just the letters used to mark possible question answers - it's a string, and also an array\ndecodeHtml: a function that converts the encoded text from the API into normal text\ngetAnswerstext: a function that takes an array of answer strings, and displays them with letters\nEach one looks like A) This is an answer\nThey are joined together by a newline character (\"\\n\")\n\n\ngenerateQuestionTextAndAnswer: a function that takes a question object, and returns the question text, along with the correct letter answer\nstartQuiz: the function that runs when the \"Start Quiz\" button is clicked - it makes the request to the API, converts the results into proper questions, and runs the quiz through prompt statements\n\n"},"ApiReviewExamples/Examples/MacroRandomizer.html":{"url":"ApiReviewExamples/Examples/MacroRandomizer.html","title":"Macro Randomizer","keywords":"","body":"API Example: Macro Randomizer\nThis website generates random image macros. It pulls a random bit of text from a variety of text-based APIs, then pulls a random image from a variety of different image APIs, and puts them together using a text-image-overlay API. This is certainly the most complex example in the lesson, but it is also the most powerful; combining multiple APIs can be quite interesting.\n\nPreview: https://macrorandomizer.hylandoutreach.repl.co/\nProject: https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/MacroRandomizer\nAPIs: Several\n\nImprovement Ideas\nThis site is already fairly functional, but of course, there are ways to improve it.\nOption Selections\nCurrently, the image that loads has a few options hardcoded in the getImageWithText function. These include:\n\noverlayColor - set to a random color hex code\ntextColor - set to white (hex+alpha code)\ntextSize - set to 32\n\nThe query parameters also include x_align, y_align, and margin - these generally make the image appear nicer. However, it may be a good idea to allow the user to change these from the default values if they would like!\nAdd number inputs and color pickers to the site to allow the user to decide some of these options.\nText & Image Sources\nCurrently, the text and image sources are chosen randomly; the page will simply pick a random API, and make a request. Instead of doing this, allow the user to decide which sources to use for the text and images!\nThis can be done via HTML dropdowns.\nStyle Updates\nCurrently, the styles for the website are pretty lacking. Make the page look better. Feel free to do whatever you'd like, but here are some ideas:\n\nCenter the button and image\nRemove the border when there is no image (e.g., right when the page loads)\nMake the button look cooler\nDynamically update the image size so it fits better\n\nBroken Images\nCurrently, some images are broken. Do some debugging to figure out what that is happening, and fix it!\nProgress\nCurrently, the loading indicator simply spins (and it takes a very long time sometimes). Instead of simply watching the indicator spin, create some sort of progress indicator based on which part of the code is currently running. This could be as simple as adding a  element to the page every time a new request is about to happen, with some information about which request is running - or it could be an actual progress bar.\nAPI Information\nThere are so many different APIs used to create this website.\nText Generation\nEach of these APIs return some sort of text.\nAdvice Slips\nThe Advice Slip API returns a piece of advice. The JSON looks something like this:\n{\n  \"slip\": {\n    \"id\": 9,\n    \"advice\": \"True happiness always resides in the quest.\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe actual text is available through the obj.slip.advice property.\nMeowFacts\nThe MeowFacts API returns a fact about a cat. The JSON looks something like this:\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    \"Cats can jump up to six times their length.\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThe actual text is available through the obj.data[0] value.\nRandom Quotes\nThe Quote Garden API returns a random quote and author. The JSON looks something like this:\n{\n  \"statusCode\": 200,\n  \"message\": \"Random quotes\",\n  \"pagination\": {\n    \"currentPage\": 1,\n    \"nextPage\": null,\n    \"totalPages\": 1\n  },\n  \"totalQuotes\": 1,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"_id\": \"5eb17ab1b69dc744b4e7b124\",\n      \"quoteText\": \"The purpose of life is a life of purpose.\",\n      \"quoteAuthor\": \"Robert Byrne\",\n      \"quoteGenre\": \"life\",\n      \"__v\": 0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThe actual text is available through obj.data[0].quoteText, and the author is available through obj.data[0].quoteAuthor.\nStoic Quotes\nThe Stoic Quotes API returns a random stoic quote. The JSON looks something like this:\n{\n  \"author\": \"TheStoicEmperor\",\n  \"quote\": \"That which we desire lies across an ocean of hard won knowledge.\"\n}\n\nThe actual text is available through obj.quote.\nImage Generation\nThere are a few different ways the code gets images.\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art\nThe Met API is the most complex in this lesson, mostly because it requires multiple API calls. The first request searches the collection, and returns a list of Object IDs.\nHere is an example URL:\nhttps://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/search?q=you can search for anything and it doesnt really matter&hasImages=true\nThe response looks something like this:\n{\n  \"total\":23,\n  \"objectIDs\":[459027,459186,437854,438821,435621,36131,459028,435848,53660,485416,39901,435809,436485,436453,72774,665702,482518,488978,206332,451263,828241,40057,39895]\n}\n\nFrom there, one random element from the obj.objectIDs array can be chosen, and used in the next API call. The next call gets information about the object.\nHere is an example URL:\nhttps://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/objects/459027\nThe response looks something like this (but with a lot more data):\n{\n  \"objectID\": 459027,\n  \"isHighlight\": true,\n  \"accessionNumber\": \"1975.1.85\",\n  \"accessionYear\": \"1975\",\n  \"isPublicDomain\": true,\n  \"primaryImage\": \"https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/rl/original/DP221483.jpg\",\n  \"primaryImageSmall\": \"https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/rl/web-large/DP221483.jpg\",\n  \"moreStuff\": \"thereseabunchmore....\"\n}\n\nFrom there, the actual image is retrieved through the obj.primaryImageSmall property. For example, something like this:\n\nshibe.online\nThe shibe.online API is thankfully much simpler. This is the same API used in the Dog Fetcher activity.\nThe URL looks like this: https://shibe.online/api/shibes?count=1\nThe JSON response looks like this:\n[\"https://cdn.shibe.online/shibes/1ea85ce4b152725f5e69f5996b5fa31cb7015576.jpg\"]\n\nThe actual image URL is retrievable through obj[0] and looks something like this:\n\ncataas\nThe cataas API is even more simple. This is the same API used in the Cat Says activity. It does not even require a fetch request - it simply returns a random image with the same URL every time.\nThe URL looks like this: https://cataas.com/cat\nThe actual image can be something like this:\n\nText Over Image API\nThis is where the magic happens. The Text Over Image API takes an image, and some text, and some other parameters, and creates a new image with the text on top of the image. There is no JSON, and no fetch - it is another example of a URL that returns an image directly. Query parameters include:\n\nimage_url: the URL for the image (generated randomly in this case)\noverlay_color: a hex+alpha value to use as an overlay layer in the image (generated randomly in this case)\ntext: the text to put on top of the image (generated randomly in this case)\ntext_color: the color of the text (set to white by default)\ntext_size: the size of the text (set to 32 by default)\nx_align: the horizontal alignment of the text (centered by default)\ny_align: the vertical alignment of the text (centered by default)\nmargin: space around the text (20 by default)\n\nAll of these come together to create the new image!\nCode Information\nThe code for this project is quite involved. There are several functions in the script.js file, and many of them are stored in variables within arrays and called dynamically.\n\nrandomFromArray: a helper function to choose a random item from an array\ngetAdvice: a function to call the advice slip API, and return the text\ngetCatFact a function to call the mew facts API, and return the text\ngetRandomQuote: a function to call the quote garden API, and return the text\ngetStoicQuote: a function to call the stoic quote API, and return th etext\ngetMetImage: a function that gets a random image URL using the Met API\ngetDogImage: a function to call the shibe.online API and return the URL for the image\ngetCatImage: a function to return a random cat image URL through the cataas API\ntextGenFunctions: an array containing all the functions that generate text\nimageGenFunctions: an array containing all the functions that generate images\ngetText: a function that chooses a random text-generating function, calls it, and returns the result\ngetImage: a function that chooses a random image-generating function, calls it, and returns the result\ngetImageWithText: a function that generates a random image, random text, and calls the Text Over Image API with the values\nnewRandomImage: the function that runs when the \"New Random Image\" button is clicked - it generates a new image and sets it on the page\n\n"},"ApiPractice/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"ApiPractice/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 9 - API Practice","keywords":"","body":"API Practice\nIn this lesson, practice using some different APIs through these guided activities.\n\ngenerate aesthetic color schemes\nsee pics of characters from ur fave tv shows\nchoose which emoji to send ur crush 😏\n\n"},"ApiPractice/ColorSchemer.html":{"url":"ApiPractice/ColorSchemer.html","title":"Color Schemer","keywords":"","body":"Color Schemer\nFollow these instructions to update a website that generates aesthetically pleasing color schemes.\nClick here to view the Color Schemer Starter Repl project. Fork the project to begin the activity.\nPart Zero: Background\nThis project is already fairly substantial in terms of the code and the functionality.\nThe User Experience\nCurrently, the user is able to select a color, click the \"Generate a New Scheme\" button, and see the colors change. There is also a \"Randomize\" button that will choose a random seed color, and then get the scheme.\nThis is functional, but it would be cool to be able to see some different types of color schemes... right now, it always uses \"quad\" mode.\nThe API\nThe code uses T H E C O L O R A P I to pull matching colors for a given seed. A ton of data is returned from each request, but only some parts of it will be relevant.\nFor example, a scheme with the color red (FF0000), in quad mode, with 4 colors, could look like this:\nURL\nhttps://www.thecolorapi.com/scheme?hex=FF0000&mode=quad&count=4\nResponse (Abbreviated)\n{\n  \"mode\": \"quad\",\n  \"count\": \"4\",\n  \"colors\": [{\n    \"hex\": {\n      \"value\": \"#70D10E\",\n    },\n    \"image\": {\n      \"named\": \"https://www.thecolorapi.com/id?format=svg&hex=70D10E\"\n    },\n    \"contrast\": {\n      \"value\": \"#000000\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"hex\": {\n      \"value\": \"#0BE4E4\",\n    },\n    \"image\": {\n      \"named\": \"https://www.thecolorapi.com/id?format=svg&hex=0BE4E4\"\n    },\n    \"contrast\": {\n      \"value\": \"#000000\"\n    }\n  }]\n}\n\nAll of the color objects within the colors property array contain the hex values used to update the website styles.\nThe Code\nThere are several functions in the script.js file that make the current site work how it does, as well as some set variables.\n\ncolorCustomProps: this is the ordered array of CSS custom properties that determine the colors for the page\nchooseRandomFromList: this chooses a random item from an array, and returns it\nrandomizeSeedColor: this chooses a random hex value, and updates the HTML color input\nrandomizeSchemeType: this function is not called yet - but it randomizes the value of the currently-non-existent scheme type dropdown\nsetNewScheme: this takes some color objects and updates the custom properties to reflect their hex values\nnewScheme: this makes the request to the API, and updates the scheme with the new colors\nrandomize: this randomizes the seed color, and then sets the new scheme\n\nNote: You don't really need to understand all the code - you can still work with it!\nThe Goal\nThese instructions show how to add a new dropdown where the user can decide which type of color scheme they would like!\nPart One: HTML\nThe first step is to add the dropdown in the HTML. This will be possible using a  element that contains  child elements. Each  should have a value attribute representing the scheme type, and the  should have an id attribute so it is identifiable in the JavaScript. All of this should be wrapped in a  element, with a  that introduces the input.\nCreating the Dropdown\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nMake a new line under the First, pick... element\nThere, create a new  element\nWithin the  and , make a new line\nThere, create a  element that says \"Next, pick a scheme type:\"\nUnder that, create a  element\nGive the  element an id of \"scheme-type\"\n\nRun the project, and verify that a new input appears! So far, the added HTML should look something like this:\n\n  Next, pick a scheme type:\n  \n\n\nAdding the Options\nThe input is useless without any options, so add some options. There should be four options total, for these types:\n\nquad\nanalogic\ncomplement\nmonochrome\n\nFirst, make a new line within the  and  tags. Then, for each of the four types:\n\nCreate a new  element\nAdd a value attribute with the given type\nAdd a capitalized name within the  and  tags\n\nRun the project, and verify that all the options appear! The added options should look something like this:\nQuad\nAnalogic\nComplement\nMonochrome\n\nPart Two: JavaScript\nNow the HTML should all be good to go, but it's not actually doing anything yet! The next step is to include the scheme type from the dropdown as a query parameter in the API request.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the newScheme function definition\nUnder the hex variable creation, make a new line\nThere, create a new variable named schemeTypeInput\nUse document.querySelector to grab the  from the HTML, and store it in the schemeTypeInput variable\nUnder that, create a new variable named schemeType\nSet schemeType to be the value of schemeTypeInput\nIn the url template literal below, remove the quad after mode=\nReplace quad with the interpolated schemeType value\n\nRun the project, select a new scheme type (like monochrome), click the \"Generate a New Scheme\" button, and see a scheme of the new type! The updated code in the newScheme function should look something like this:\nasync function newScheme() {\n  // ...\n  let schemeTypeInput = document.querySelector(\"#scheme-type\");\n  let schemeType = schemeTypeInput.value;\n\n  let url = `https://www.thecolorapi.com/scheme?hex=${hex}&mode=${schemeType}&count=4`;\n  // ...\n}\n\nPart Three: Randomization\nThe final step is to include the scheme type in the randomization that happens when the \"Randomize\" button is clicked. Luckily, there is already a function that does this!\n\nOpen the script.js file\nFind the randomize function definition\nMake a new line above the call to the newScheme function\nThere, call the randomizeSchemeType function\n\nRun the project, click the \"Randomize\" button, and verify that a random scheme type is selected! The updated code in the randomize function should look something like this:\nasync function randomize() {\n  randomizeSeedColor();\n  randomizeSchemeType();\n  await newScheme();\n}\n\nConclusion\nThe update may have been a small part of the overall functionality of the site, but being able to work with existing code and make it better is a huge part of software development. There are quite a few additional updates you could try to make - if you have any interest, try to make it whatever you'd like! Here are some ideas:\n\nUpdate the sample text and content so that it is more reflective of a real website\nAdd additional colors through CSS custom properties, and grab more colors from the API call\nDisplay the colors (and even their names) every time a new color scheme is set\nAdd more scheme types based on the scheme modes: monochrome-dark, monochrome-light, analogic-complement, and triad\n\nFeel free to use the API for any desired purpose.\n"},"ApiPractice/TvCharacters.html":{"url":"ApiPractice/TvCharacters.html","title":"TV Characters","keywords":"","body":"TV Characters\nFollow these instructions to update a website that displays characters from TV shows.\nClick here to view the TV Characters Starter Repl project. Fork the project to begin the activity.\nPart Zero: Background\nThere is significant code and functionality already built into this project.\nThe User Experience\nWhen someone goes to the page, they are able to click the \"Load Characters\" button to see characters from Stranger Things appear.\nThe API\nThe API that makes this possible is named TVMAZE. There are a variety of endpoints that return data about TV shows. The TV Characters site uses the /singlesearch/ endpoint to get data about Stranger Things, and the cast data is embedded. The URL is static, so it currently returns the same data each time. It looks something like this:\nURL\nhttps://api.tvmaze.com/singlesearch/shows?q=Stranger Things&embed=cast\nResponse (Abbreviated)\n{\n  \"id\": 2993,\n  \"url\": \"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/2993/stranger-things\",\n  \"name\": \"Stranger Things\",\n  \"summary\": \"A love letter to the '80s classics that captivated a generation, Stranger Things is set in 1983 Indiana, where a young boy vanishes into thin air. As friends, family and local police search for answers, they are drawn into an extraordinary mystery involving top-secret government experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one very strange little girl.\",\n  \"_embedded\": {\n    \"cast\": [\n      {\n        \"person\": {\n          \"name\": \"Winona Ryder\",\n          \"image\": {\n            \"medium\": \"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/204/511427.jpg\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"character\": {\n          \"name\": \"Joyce Byers\",\n          \"image\": {\n            \"medium\": \"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/406/1015330.jpg\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"person\": {\n          \"name\": \"Caleb McLaughlin\",\n          \"image\": {\n            \"medium\": \"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/16/40907.jpg\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"character\": {\n          \"name\": \"Lucas Sinclair\",\n          \"image\": {\n            \"medium\": \"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/410/1027426.jpg\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nAll the data that renders is in the _embedded.cast array property.\nThe Code\nThere are several functions in the script.js file that make the current site work how it does.\n\nobjectToHtml: takes a JSON data object and returns an HTML element with a nice image/name\ngetCharactersForShow: makes the request to the API - currently returns information about Stranger Things\nloadCharacters: makes the call to get the data, and then puts it on the page\n\nThe Goal\nRight now, the site is exclusively about Stranger Things. Update it so that it can display characters from any TV show!\nPart One: The HTML\nFirst, there needs to be a way for the user to say which TV show they would like.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nMake a new line under the Characters element\nThere, create a new  element\nSet the type attribute to be \"text\"\nSet the id attribute to be \"tv-show\"\nSet the placeholder attribute to be \"Enter a TV Show\"\n\nRun the project and verify that the new text box appears! The added HTML should look like this:\n\n\nPart Two: Function Parameterization\nNext, the JavaScript code needs to take what the user enters, and pass it along to get the data.\nUpdating the Definition\nCurrently, the getCharactersForShow function does not take any arguments. Add a parameter so that it will be possible to pass a show search query into the API.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the getCharactersForShow function definition\nAdd a parameter named show between the parentheses\n\nThe updated code should look like this:\nasync function getCharactersForShow(show) { /* ... */ }\n\nUpdating the Call\nNow, it will be possible to pass the value to the function call.\n\nFind the loadCharacters function definition\nMake a new line above the characters variable creation\nThere, create a new variable named tvShowInput\nUse document.querySelector to grab the  from the HTML, and store it in the tvShowInput variable\nUnder that, create a new variable named tvShow\nSet tvShow to be the value of tvShowInput\nUnder that, update the call to getCharactersForShow by passing tvShow as an argument\n\nNothing will actually change yet, but now the getCharactersForShow function has a show to use! The updated code should look something like this:\nlet tvShowInput = document.querySelector(\"#tv-show\");\nlet tvShow = tvShowInput.value;\nlet characters = await getCharactersForShow(tvShow);\n\nPart Three: Query Parameterization\nHere's where the magic happens. The API call can be updated to search for whatever show the user entered in the text box!\n\nFind the getCharactersForShow function\nFind the url variable creation\nIn the template literal for it, remove Stranger Things\nReplace it with the interpolated value of the show parameter\n\nRun the project, enter a real TV show, click the button, and verify that characters from that TV show appear! The updated URL code should look something like this:\nlet url = `https://api.tvmaze.com/singlesearch/shows?q=${show}&embed=cast`;\n\nPart Four: Handling an Error\nNow this is all well and good, but what happens when a fake show title is entered? Luckily, there is a try/catch in place, so a message like TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '_embedded') may be alerted. That message is not very clear, though... the site can do better.\nBackground\nHTTP responses have status codes that indicate the success of the request. For example, a 404 error indicates that a resource has not been found. In the case of the TVMAZE API, it will return a 404 response if a TV search does not return any results.\nThe status code is returned with the response object from a fetch call, so it is possible to check it. It is also possible to use throw to display a new message to bubble up in the try/catch.\nThe goal will be to display a new message if the search fails, and the entered show is not found!\nThe Code\nAfter the response is returned, it will be possible to handle any errors gracefully.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the getCharactersForShow function definition\nFind the fetch call in the try block\nMake a new line under that\nThere, create an if structure\nIn the if condition, check if response.status is equal to 404\nIn the body block of the if statement, use throw to send an error message of \"Show not found ☹\"\n\nNow, run the project, enter a fake show, and verify that a nicer error message is alerted! The added code should look something like this:\nif (response.status === 404) {\n  throw `Show not found ☹`;\n}\n\nConclusion\nThis activity showed another example of an API with a lot of possibility. The code only used a small part of the data returned, but so much more of it could be useful! Here are some ideas for this API:\n\nDisplay both the character and the actor for each entry\nDisplay more information about each new show, such as the description or the image\nUpdate the CSS colors/fonts so that they are not specific to Stranger Things\nMake each character \"card\" a link that can go to the character page (like this)\n\nFeel free to use the API for any desired purpose.\n"},"ApiPractice/EmojiCrush.html":{"url":"ApiPractice/EmojiCrush.html","title":"Emoji Crush","keywords":"","body":"Emoji Crush\nFollow these instructions to create a website that displays information about a random emoji.\nClick here to view the Emoji Crush Starter Repl project. Fork the project to begin the activity.\nPart Zero: Background\nThere is basically no starter code for this project, but the API will make it relatively simple to add functionality to the site.\nThe API\nThe API that makes this possible is named EmojiHub. There are a couple endpoints available, but the important one is the one that returns data about a random emoji. The URL is static, but it will return a variety of random different emoji.\nURL\nhttps://emojihub.yurace.pro/api/random\nResponse\n{\n  \"name\": \"shark\",\n  \"category\": \"animals and nature\",\n  \"group\": \"animal marine\",\n  \"htmlCode\": [\n    \"&#129416;\"\n    ],\n  \"unicode\": [\n    \"U+1F988\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThe important pieces of data are the name, the category, and the htmlCode.\nThe Goal\nThe goal is to generate a random emoji, and add some information to the site when the button is clicked!\nPart One: HTML From JavaScript\nTo start, it may be worthwhile to look at the HTML on its own, for one example emoji.\nDemonstrating the HTML\nPurely for demonstration purposes, add some code to make information about the eye emoji appear.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nFind the  element\nMake a new line within the opening and closing tags\nThere, add a  element that says \"You should send them the &#128065; emoji\nWrap the emoji code in a \nThis will allow it to be styled with CSS\n\n\nUnder the , make another \nMake it say \"This emoji is named eye and it is from the smileys and people category\"\nWrap the \"eye\" and \"smileys and people\" text in  elements\nUnder that, add another \nMake it say \"Sending them this emoji will definitely make them like you\"\nWrap the \"definitely\" in an  to make it italic\n\nAlternatively to all that, feel free to copy and paste this code into the index.html file:\nYou should send them the &#128065; emoji\nThis emoji is named eye and it is from the smileys and people category\nSending them this emoji will definitely make them like you\n\nRun the project to see how it looks!\nBuilding HTML from JavaScript\nTo start making this more functional, define a function that will dynamically add the HTML to the page.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nDefine a function named showEmoji\nIn the body of the showEmoji function, create a variable named textElement\nUse document.querySelector to grab the  from the HTML, and store it in the textElement variable\nOn the next line, set the textElement.innerHTML property to be a new template literal\nMake some new lines within the template literal, and paste in the HTML code from above\nRemove the HTML code from the index.html file as it is no longer needed\n\nRun the project, click the \"Click Me\" button, and verify that information about the eye emoji appears! The added code should look something like this:\nfunction showEmoji() {\n  let textElement = document.querySelector(\"#emoji-text\");\n\n  textElement.innerHTML = `\nYou should send them the &#128065; emoji\nThis emoji is named eye and it is from the smileys and people category\nSending them this emoji will definitely make them like you\n`;\n}\n\nPart Two: Dummy Data\nNow this works for one emoji, but it is still very static. The raw HTML contains hard-coded values. Instead, use some dummy data to prepare the showEmoji function for working with real live data.\nThe main idea with this is to create some mock data to pretend the API is returning actual data. That way, it will be possible to define how to handle the data even before there is real data! This separation of concerns can be very helpful in software development; breaking large problems into bite-sized tasks can make them feel much less overwhelming. Take it one step at a time!\nDefining the Dummy Data\nThe example data can be created based on a response from the API. The important thing is that it should be in the same format, and have all the same properties and structure. The shark example from the response above will be used for this dummy data.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line at the very top of the file\nThere, create a new variable named exampleData\nSet exampleData to be an empty object\nAdd a name property to the object with a value of \"shark\"\nAdd a category property to the object with a value of \"animals and nature\"\nAdd a group property to the object with a value of \"animal marine\"\nAdd a htmlCode property to the object with a value of [\"&#129416;\"]\nNote: this is an array with one element\n\n\nAdd a unicode property to the object with a value of [\"U+1F988\"]\nNote: this is an array with one element\n\n\n\nThe added variable should end up looking something like this:\nlet exampleData = {\n  name: \"shark\",\n  category: \"animals and nature\",\n  group: \"animal marine\",\n  htmlCode: [\"&#129416;\"],\n  unicode:[\"U+1F988\"]\n};\n\nThis simulates the response that would be received from a real fetch API call.\nExtracting the Dummy Data\nThe next step is for the showEmoji function to grab that data, find the relevant pieces, and use those pieces in the rendered HTML.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the showEmoji function body\nMake a new line under the textElement variable creation\nThere, create a new variable named emojiData, set to exampleData\nUnder that, create a new variable named emoji\nSet emoji to be the first element from the htmlCode property of the emojiData object\nUnder that, create another new variable named name\nSet name to be the name property of the emojiData object\nUnder that, create another new variable named category\nSet category to be the category property of the emojiData object\n\nThe added code should look something like this:\nlet emojiData = exampleData;\n\nlet emoji = emojiData.htmlCode[0];\nlet name = emojiData.name;\nlet category = emojiData.category;\n\nNow all the data has been extracted, but it still has to be used!\nPassing the Dummy Data\nNext, insert that data into the rendered HTML.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing, and find the body of the showEmoji function\nFind where the textElement.innerHTML property is set\nIn the template literal, remove the eye HTML code in the first \nReplace the code with the interpolated value of the emoji variable\nReplace the word eye with the interpolated name value\nReplace the \"smileys and people\" with the interpolated category value\n\nRun the project, click the button, and verify that shark emoji information appears! The updated code with the interpolated variables in the template literal should look something like this:\n  textElement.innerHTML = `\nYou should send them the ${emoji} emoji\nThis emoji is named ${name} and it is from the ${category} category\nSending them this emoji will definitely make them like you\n`;\n}\n\nPart Three: Real Data\nNow it's time to get real. Instead of using that dummy data, the code should make a call to the EmojiHub API, and return that data.\nDefining the Function to Fetch Data\nThe first step is to setup the fetch call.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nDefine a new function named fetchEmojiData\nMake the function asynchronous with the async keyword\n\n\nIn the function body, declare a new variable named emojiData\nUnder that, setup a try/catch structure\nIn the try block, create a new variable named response\nSet response to an awaited call to fetch\nPass in the proper URL to the function call: https://emojihub.yurace.pro/api/random\nUnder that in the try, set emojiData to an awaited response.json() function call\nIn the catch block, alert the error message\nOutside of the try/catch, at the bottom of the body, return emojiData\n\nThe function definition should look something like this:\nasync function fetchEmojiData() {\n  let emojiData;\n\n  try {\n    let response = await fetch(`https://emojihub.yurace.pro/api/random`);\n    emojiData = await response.json();\n  } catch (e) {\n    alert(e);\n  }\n\n  return emojiData;\n}\n\nCalling the Function\nNow that the function has been defined, it must be called!\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake the showEmoji function asynchronous with the async keyword\nIn the body of the showEmoji function, find the emojiData variable creation\nReplace exampleData with an awaited call to the fetchEmojiData function\nRemove the exampleData variable from the top of the file\n\nNow, run the project, click the button, and verify that a random emoji appears! The added code for this part should look like this:\nlet emojiData = await fetchEmojiData();\n\nConclusion\nIt is certainly more difficult to build something from scratch, but it also helps reinforce the concepts quite a bit. This API has fairly simple data, but it can be used in powerful and creative ways!\nFinal Code\nThe code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nasync function fetchEmojiData() {\n  let emojiData;\n\n  try {\n    let response = await fetch(`https://emojihub.yurace.pro/api/random`);\n    emojiData = await response.json();\n  } catch (e) {\n    alert(e);\n  }\n\n  return emojiData;\n}\n\nasync function showEmoji() {\n  let textElement = document.querySelector(\"#emoji-text\");\n  let emojiData = await fetchEmojiData();\n\n  let emoji = emojiData.htmlCode[0];\n  let name = emojiData.name;\n  let category = emojiData.category;\n\n  textElement.innerHTML = `\nYou should send them the ${emoji} emoji\nThis emoji is named ${name} and it is from the ${category} category\nSending them this emoji will definitely make them like you\n`;\n}\n\nUpdate Ideas\nThe site is pretty good as-is, but there is always room for improvement. Here are some ideas:\n\nUpdate the CSS for the page\nAllow the user to select a category for the emoji like this\nDisplay more than one emoji if requested\nDisplay the group in addition to the category\n\nFeel free to use the API for any desired purpose.\n"},"FinalProject/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"FinalProject/StudentDesc.html","title":"Final Project","keywords":"","body":"Final Project\nThis project is the culmination of everything you have learned over the course of this semester!
